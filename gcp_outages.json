Affected customers received Google 404 errors in response to HTTP/S requests.\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue via automated alerting at 09:50 PT, which aligned with incoming customer support requests, and we immediately started to mitigate the issue by rolling back to the last known good configuration.\nBetween 09:35 and 10:08 PT, customers affected by the outage may have encountered 404 errors when accessing any web page (URL) served by Google External Proxy Load Balancing.\nA rollback to the last known good configuration completed at 10:08 PT, which resolved the 404 errors. To avoid the risk of a recurrence, our engineers suspended customer-initiated configuration changes in GCLB. As a result, GCLB service customers were unable to make changes to their load balancing configuration between 10:04 and 11:28 PT.\nDuring the change suspension period, we validated the fix to safeguard against recurrence and deployed additional proctoring and monitoring to ensure safe resumption of service.\nBy 11:28 PT, customer configuration pushes resumed, and normal service was restored. The total duration of impact was 1 hour and 53 minutes.\n## Root Cause\nThis incident was caused by a bug in the configuration pipeline that propagates customer configuration rules to GCLB. The bug was introduced 6 months ago and allowed a race condition (when behavior depends on the timing of data accesses) that would, in very rare cases, push a corrupted configuration file to GCLB. The GCLB update pipeline contains extensive validation checks to prevent corrupt configurations, but the race condition was one that could corrupt the file near the end of the pipeline.\nA Google engineer discovered this bug on 12 November, which caused us to declare an internal high-priority incident because of the latent risk to production systems. After analyzing the bug, we froze a part of our configuration system to make the likelihood of the race condition even lower. Since the race condition had existed in the fleet for several months already, the team believed that this extra step made the risk even lower. Thus the team believed the lowest-risk path, especially given the proximity to BFCM, was to roll out fixes in a controlled manner as opposed to a same-day emergency patch.\nWe developed two mitigations: patch A closed the race condition itself; and patch B added additional input validation to the binary receiving the configuration to prevent it from accepting the new configuration, even if the race condition occurred.\nBoth patches were ready and verified to fix the problem by 13 November. Gradual rollouts of both patches started on Monday, 15 November, and patch B completed rollout by that evening. On Tuesday, 16 November, as the patch A rollout was within 30 minutes of completing, the race condition did manifest in an unpatched cluster, and the outage started.\nAdditionally, even though patch B did protect against the kind of input errors observed during testing, the actual race condition produced a different form of error in the configuration, which the completed rollout of patch B did not prevent from being accepted.\nOnce the root cause was identified, our engineers mitigated the issue by restoring a known-good configuration, and completed and verified the fix, which eliminates the risk of recurrence.\n## Service(s) Affected:\n- Google Cloud Networking: Customer HTTP/S endpoints served 404 error pages. During partial recovery, traffic was served, but customers were unable to make changes to their load balancer configurations.\n- GCLB can be used to load balance traffic to a number of other Google Cloud services, which lost traffic because of the outage. Customers who use serverless network endpoint groups on GCLB as a frontend to Google Cloud Run, Google App Engine, Google App Engine Flex, or Google Cloud Functions received 404 errors when attempting to access their service. Customers using Apigee, Firebase, or Google App Engine Flex received 404 errors when attempting to access their service.\n## Zone(s) Affected:\nGlobal\n## How Customers Experienced the Issue:\nBetween 09:35 and 10:08 PT, most endpoints served by global GCLB load balancers returned a 404 error. For an additional 1 hour and 20 minutes, customers were unable to make changes to their load balancing configuration.\n## Workaround(s):\nNone.\nService was restored on 16 November 2021 at 11:28 PT, and the Google Cloud Status Dashboard was updated by 12:08 PT to reflect this.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nWe have fixed the underlying bug and are taking the following actions to prevent recurrence:\nWe immediately added additional alerting, which will notify us to similar issues significantly faster going forward.\nWe are adding safeguards to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. These safeguards provide strengthened automated correctness-checking to configurations before they are applied.\nWe are accelerating planned architectural changes that will improve how we isolate and resolve such issues in the future.",

We apologize for the inconvenience and are taking steps toward preventing recurrence in the future.\n## Root Cause\nCloud Monitoring is a global service but is subdivided into internal locales, each of which collect monitoring data which is generated locally. When users query Cloud Monitoring, each query fans out through a series of nodes (called mixers) within the corresponding locales. The mixers reach out to source nodes to gather the appropriate data, temporarily retaining it within a limited set of memory.\nDuring a recent infrastructure change in the U.S. locale, the amount of memory allocated to mixers in the us-central1 region was inadvertently reduced. This caused mixer tasks to run low on memory. The number of tasks in a low memory state grew over a period of several days as the change was gradually rolled out to production, following Google's standard progressive rollout policies.\nThe mixer task has safeguards which are designed to detect and reduce the impact of low memory conditions by pausing queries that use significant memory. However, in this case, an existing misconfiguration of this safeguard prevented it from activating correctly. Eventually, tasks which were low on memory failed; enough tasks failed in total to cause widespread failures and service impact.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the problem on 19 October 2021 at 11:11 and immediately started an investigation. Root cause - the reduction in memory allocation for mixer nodes - was identified at 11:32. Google engineers quickly identified a mitigation, which we began to roll out at 11:50. Restoring the proper memory capacity for mixer nodes fully mitigated the issue at 12:54.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions.\nWe are taking the following immediate steps to prevent this or similar issues from happening again:\n- Fixing the misconfiguration so that mixers which are low on memory will correctly detect that condition.\n- Introduce load-shedding, such that mixers which run out of memory will simply reject new queries until memory usage subsides, rather than failing.\n- Optimize the mixers to reduce the likelihood of out-of-memory scenarios.\n- Modifying Cloud Monitoring's rollout automation so that it automatically spots problems of this type, allowing engineers to be alerted sooner.",

The issue persisted for 11 hours, 20 minutes.\nAll customers in the United States who use credit card billing were inadvertently notified via email “Your payment information could not be processed. Visit the payment overview page to make sure your payment information is up to date and to pay any outstanding charges.” Customers also received a notification alert in the Google Cloud Console to update their primary payment method. After customers attempted to update their payment information in the admin console, they received a message that the payment could not be processed.\nWe sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused by the incorrect notification to our customers. Our engineering team has deployed a fix for this and has ensured that account settings are restored. We are taking additional steps to prevent similar problems in the future, as outlined below.\nRoot Cause\nThe trigger for this service disruption was an update to the payment configuration intended to support virtual credit cards (one-time credit card numbers from Visa and MasterCard). This update unintentionally caused a situation in which no credit card payments were able to be processed in the U.S. region and resulted in payment failure notifications being sent out to affected customers.

      "text": "INCIDENT REPORT (Combined GCP / WS)\nSummary\nOn 22 September 2021 14:10 US/Pacific, Google Cloud, Workspace, and Geo (Maps) customers in the United States (U.S.) incorrectly received alert notifications on the Google Cloud Console user interface and an email regarding an issue with processing automatic payments. The issue persisted for 11 hours, 20 minutes.\nAll customers in the United States who use credit card billing were inadvertently notified via email “Your payment information could not be processed. Visit the payment overview page to make sure your payment information is up to date and to pay any outstanding charges.” Customers also received a notification alert in the Google Cloud Console to update their primary payment method. After customers attempted to update their payment information in the admin console, they received a message that the payment could not be processed.\nWe sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused by the incorrect notification to our customers. Our engineering team has deployed a fix for this and has ensured that account settings are restored. We are taking additional steps to prevent similar problems in the future, as outlined below.\nRoot Cause\nThe trigger for this service disruption was an update to the payment configuration intended to support virtual credit cards (one-time credit card numbers from Visa and MasterCard). This update unintentionally caused a situation in which no credit card payments were able to be processed in the U.S. region and resulted in payment failure notifications being sent out to affected customers. Google's standard change control policy is to roll out all production updates progressively; however, in this specific case, errors in the rollout process meant that the change rolled out much more rapidly. Addressing this is a key part of our corrective actions.\nRemediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue on 22 September 2021 15:28 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation.

In this case, the Pull Request Triggers – with comment control enabled – failed for some users with the ‘writer’ role. From preliminary analysis, the issue was caused by an unexpected response received from the GitHub collaborator API call used to validate user permissions.\n**Customer Impact:**\n- GCP builds failed to initiate when GitHub Pull Requests were created by users granted ‘write’ permissions on a repository via team permissions.\n- “Needs /gcbrun from a collaborator” error message was displayed after Triggers failed.\n**Additional details:**\n- The issue was mitigated after our engineering team rolled out a mitigation to unblock comment controlled triggers that are invoked by users with the ‘writer’ role.",

The underlying Cloud Networking impact ended at 20:41, however, some Cloud Services took longer to recover - delaying the all clear until 21:20. Any service that uses Cloud Networking may have seen impact. We have included available details of service specific impact below; however, this may not be a comprehensive accounting of all downstream networking impact. From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was transient voltage at the feeder to the network equipment, causing the equipment to reboot. In order to mitigate the issue, traffic within the australia-southeast2 region was redirected temporarily.\n**Customer Impact:**\n- Cloud Networking: Public IP traffic connectivity failed from 19:51 to 20:41.\n- Cloud L7 Load Balancers: Partial dataplane query loss and control plane operational delay for External load balancers from 19:50 - 20:12, and Internal load balancers from 19:50 - 20:18.\n- Cloud L4 Load Balancing Inbound public IP traffic was dropped from 19:51 to 20:41.\n- Cloud Interconnect: Up to 100% packet loss between 19:50 and 20:21.\n- Cloud NAT experienced control plane failures from 19:51 to 20:00.\n- Cloud VPN HA dropped up to 83% of traffic between 19:51 and 20:21, while Legacy VPN dropped ~100% of traffic between 19:51 and 20:41.\n- Cloud SQL: 100% error rate from 19:49 to 20:01.\n- Cloud Storage: 100% error rate through 21:20.\n- Cloud Functions:\n- Cloud Run: 100% error rate through 21:19.\n- Cloud Bigtable: 100% error rate from 19:49 to 20:01 and increased latency from 20:01 to 20:13.\n- Cloud Logging: Logs written within the region may have failed to be ingested from 20:07 to 21:18.\n- Cloud Monitoring: Customers may have experienced falsely firing alerts, missed alerts, missing metrics and failed writes from 19:50 to 20:15.\n- Google Compute Engine: Operations to create or modify instances failed from 19:52 to 20:12. Connectivity from instances to other GCP services may be affected until 20:26. Existing instances may have lost network connectivity. Additionally autoscaling had delays or errors collecting input data which may have impacted autoscaling decisions.\n- Google Kubernetes Engine: Control plane operations on regional clusters failed between 19:50 and 20:04. Increased latency from 20:05 to 20:41. 100% of requests to container.googleapis.com failed\n- Persistent Disk: Up to 100% device unavailability between 19:51 and 20:13.\n- Cloud Filestore: Up to 100% error rate from 19:50 to 20:03.\n- Cloud IAM: ~80% error rate from 19:52 to 20:10.\n- Cloud Spanner: 100% error rate between 19:53 and 20:09.\n- Cloud Pub/Sub: Increased error rate and latency of up to 95% between 19:50 and 20:12.\n- Cloud Dataflow: Increased errors starting jobs and making progress on existing jobs between 19:50 and 20:12.\n- Cloud Dataproc: New cluster creation failed from 20:09 until 21:20\n- Cloud Firestore: Control Plane saw ~90% error rates from 19:50 to 20:03.

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Support by opening a case using https://cloud.google.com/support\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 28 July 2021 19:24\n**Incident End:** 30 July 2021 18:52\n**Duration:** 1 day, 23 hours and 28 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nGoogle Cloud Dataproc - Ability to view and access Component Gateway URLs [1]\n**Regions/Zones:**\nasia-east1, asia-east2, asia-northeast1, asia-northeast3, asia-south1, asia-southeast1, asia-southeast2, australia-southeast1, europe-north1, europe-west1, europe-west2, europe-west4, europe-west6, northamerica-northeast1, southamerica-east1, us-central1, us-east1, us-east4, us-west1\n**Description:**\nGoogle Cloud Dataproc experienced elevated 400 errors indicating “Bad Requests” when accessing the component gateway URLs[1] for a duration of around 2 days. From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was a rollout that started on 28 July 2021 at 12:45. The rollout was paused preventing further regions from being affected and a rollback started on 30 July 2021 at 9:18 to mitigate the issue in affected regions . During the incident, a workaround was provided which was to use the SSH SOCKS proxy as described in doc [2] to access the component gateway URLs.\n**Customer Impact:**\nGoogle Cloud Dataproc- Accessing component gateway URLs failed with 400 errors.\n**References:**\n[1] https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/accessing/dataproc-gateways#viewing_and_accessing_component_gateway_urls\n[2] https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/accessing/cluster-web-interfaces",

This issue impacted creation of resources that depend on PD-SSD. The root cause of the issue was an unexpected increase in utilization of PD-SSD, which led to unavailability of SSD capacity for some users in the impacted zones.\n**Customer Impact:**\n* Google Compute Engine (GCE) : * Issues with new VM creations as boot disk creations failed. * Auto-scaling of VMs was impacted due to failure with new VM creations. * Intermittent reduction in write throughput. * Issues with expanding SSD-backed device sizes.\n* Cloud Composer: * Failed Cloud Composer environment creations.\n* Cloud SQL: * Intermittent create operation failures. * PD-SSD disk size increases failures.\n* Cloud Build: * Cloud Builds using custom size VMs or using workerpools experienced failures.\n* Google Kubernetes Engine: * Intermittent issues with cluster creation. * Intermittent issues with creation and scaling of node pools with PD-SSD nodes.\n* Dataproc/Dataflow: * Dataproc cluster creation and Dataflow jobs may have failed due to underlying errors regarding disk creation failures.\n**Additional details:**\nTo prevent unexpected spike in utilization from impacting PD-SSD capacity availability, the following actions and safety measures were implemented:\n* Engineering team has identified and throttled the source of the unexpected spike in PD-SSD utilization.\n* Additional SSD capacity added for higher tolerance to spikes in utilization.\n* Increased rebalancing to make additional SSD capacity available.",

This issue impacted creation of resources that depend on PD-SSD. The root cause of the issue was an unexpected increase in utilization of PD-SSD, which led to unavailability of SSD capacity for some users in the impacted zones.\n**Customer Impact:**\n* Google Compute Engine (GCE) : * Issues with new VM creations as boot disk creations failed. * Auto-scaling of VMs was impacted due to failure with new VM creations. * Intermittent reduction in write throughput. * Issues with expanding SSD-backed device sizes.\n* Cloud Composer: * Failed Cloud Composer environment creations.\n* Cloud SQL: * Intermittent create operation failures. * PD-SSD disk size increases failures.\n* Cloud Build: * Cloud Builds using custom size VMs or using workerpools experienced failures.\n* Google Kubernetes Engine: * Intermittent issues with cluster creation. * Intermittent issues with creation and scaling of node pools with PD-SSD nodes.\n* Dataproc/Dataflow: * Dataproc cluster creation and Dataflow jobs may have failed due to underlying errors regarding disk creation failures.\n**Additional details:**\nTo prevent unexpected spike in utilization from impacting PD-SSD capacity availability, the following actions and safety measures were implemented:\n* Engineering team has identified and throttled the source of the unexpected spike in PD-SSD utilization.\n* Additional SSD capacity added for higher tolerance to spikes in utilization.\n* Increased rebalancing to make additional SSD capacity available.",

        "text": "INCIDENT REPORT\n**Summary:**\nOn Thursday, May 20, 2021 at 05:25 US/Pacific, Google Cloud products experienced elevated latency and/or errors due to an issue with Access Control Lists (ACLs) intermittently for a duration of 10 hours and 45 minutes. The affected ACLs in this instance were internal that are used to define permissions for Google’s internal production resources. This prevented some internal service accounts from accessing various production jobs, which led to the downstream service impact. We apologize to our Cloud customers whose businesses were impacted during this disruption, and we are taking immediate action to improve the resiliency, performance, and availability of our services to avoid a recurrence.\n**Root Cause:**\nGoogle’s datacenters rely on Access Control Lists (ACLs) stored in a highly available lock service to perform operations, including validating permissions, activating new APIs, or creating new cloud resources. The access distribution manager, which maintains ACLs across Google production, encompasses both the control plane systems that allow for users to edit groups and the jobs which write the intended current state into the data plane, which is stored in a lock service as a set of signed ACL files.\nThe incident was triggered by a latent concurrency issue in a component of the production ACL system combined with a missing safety check, which led to truncation of ACLs across a subset of production. The safety mechanism for the legacy ACL components was inadvertently disabled by a change to update to the latest version in a subset of datacenters. The disabled safety checks in the legacy ACL component jobs allowed the invalid ACLs to be processed. The ACL component identified membership removals in the data snapshot and proceeded to remove ACL files from a backend locking service and passed the invalid ACLs to the backend stack, which correctly failed the safety checks.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue by automated alerting on 20 May 2021 at 05:55 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. At 06:07, engineers identified an incomplete data snapshot being written, and a safety check mechanism was unexpectedly removing group memberships. At 06:21, engineers began mitigation efforts to terminate ACL component jobs globally to prevent further impact. To identify the root cause, engineers compared jobs serving affected datacenters and verified they were served by legacy ACL components, while those which were not affected were served using the latest version of safety check flags. The next phase of the mitigation strategy was to restore most critical group memberships that were removed. Simultaneously, the failing ACL component jobs were being configured to apply the correct safety checks and prepared to restart to restore healthy memberships. By 07:32, engineers worked to repair and restore the legacy stack jobs to write the correct ACLs in impacted datacenters. By 07:44, we began manually restoring critical ACLs.\nBy 15:09, most of the production fleet was mitigated and engineers continued to restore the remaining ACLs. At 16:10, the ACL issues across production were fully mitigated.\nWe apologize for the length and severity of this incident. We are taking immediate steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future.\n**Detailed Description of Impact:**\nOn Thursday, May 20, 2021 from 05:25 to 16:10 US/Pacific, Google Cloud Infrastructure components experienced a service disruption which had varying degrees of impact to downstream services as described in detail below:\n**BigQuery**\nExperienced elevated error rates running queries and streaming in europe-west2. Around 5% of projects in the region were impacted with 0.63% failed query jobs and 3% of failed requests for streaming inserts from 06:10 to 07:30 PT.\n**Cloud Data Catalog**\nExperienced elevated error rates (30-40%) with permissions when reading backend databases in europe-west2 from 10:15 PT to 11:35 PT.\n**Cloud Logging**\nExperienced delayed logs in Google Cloud Storage (GCS) export pipeline in europe-west2 from 07:45 to 11:31 PT.\n**Cloud SQL**\nExperienced elevated error rates and latency on Admin APIs in the following regions from 06:51 to 09:44 PT: asia-south2, asia-southeast1, australia-southeast1, europe-north1, europe-west2, europe-west4, europe-west6, northamerica-northeast1, southamerica-east1, us-central1, us-central2, us-east1, us-east4, us-west1 and europe-west1. Among most impacted operations, instance creation (instances.insert) had an error ratio of 69%. Additionally, 10% of successful responses to instance.insert later experienced downstream creation failures. Changes to instance configs (instances.update and instances.patch) had 96% and 87% error rates respectively. Existing instances had no significant connectivity impact. Customers using gcloud sql to connect from new IP addresses that had not yet been added to the ACL, would have been unable to connect.\n**Cloud Bigtable**\nData API experienced elevated latency and error rates up to 10% in europe-west2 from 06:30 to 09:33 PT.\n**Cloud Dataproc**\nExperienced elevated latency of 95% with cluster creation and deletion in europe-west2.\n**Cloud Vertex AI**\nExperienced service degradation in europe-west2 which caused 15% of API requests to fail from 06:57 to 10:28 PT.\n**Cloud AI Platform**\nExperienced up to 100% widespread backend error rates in europe-west2 from 06:15 to 12:40 PT.\n**Cloud Dataflow**\nExperienced jobs stuck in a pending state; jobs were unable to be terminated or cancelled; jobs were unable to migrate backends which resulted in stuck progress; and streaming jobs experienced delays in europe-west2. 35% of projects were impacted in the region from 06:06 to 12:37 PT.\n**Cloud Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**\nUp to 75% of DLP worker tasks were down in europe-west2. 25% error rate averaged across all method types from 10:28 to 11:36 PT.\n**Google Compute Engine (GCE)**\nSome GCE APIs experienced degraded availability and elevated error rates up to 40% in europe-west2 and europe-west3. Customers also experienced delays in VM creation and deletion operations in us-west2-a from 06:50 to 11:48 PT.\n**Cloud Composer**\nExperienced composer environment creation and update operation failures up to 80% globally from 06:08 to 11:07 PT. Existing environments may have experienced service errors.\n**AppEngine Flexible**\nExperienced deployment failures with timeouts or reporting success globally. Approximately 21% of affected projects experienced 503 errors after deploying a new version, and approximately 79% of affected projects experienced deployment deadline exceeded errors from 05:45 to 09:30 PT.\n**Cloud Networking**\nCustomer initiated control plane config changes related to load balancing products were delayed globally from 05:28 PT to 09:15 PT. Creation or changes to existing Network Load Balancers were delayed in europe-west2 (from 06:20 to 10:05 PT) and europe-west3 (from 07:19 to 10:05 PT). Customers who didn't command config changes during the incident were not affected.\n**Cloud Armor**\nNew Cloud Armor configs were delayed globally from 05:35 to 09:15 PT.\n**Cloud Console**\nExperienced elevated error rates up to 100% while accessing some pages of the console. 2.82% of users were impacted globally from 07:03 to 10:00 PT.\n**Artifact Registry**\nExperienced errors for several HTTP-Maven/Docker and ScottyAgent requests in europe-west1 and australia-southeast1 from 06:20 - 09:45 PT.\n**Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**\nExperienced elevated “400” errors up to 95% which were mostly deadline exceeded errors for 3 hours in europe-west2 from 07:25 to 10:22 PT.\n**Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**\nCustomers were unable to create new clusters for around 2 hours in europe-west2 and europe-west3 from 08:20 to 10:10 PT.\n**Identity and Access Management (IAM)**\nEurope-west2: Checkpolicy <0.01% error rate (2-3 qps) from 6:02 to 11:33 PT\nGlobalization Expand RPC served elevated latency everywhere from 6:47 to 10:02 PT.\n**Persistent Disk (PD)**\nUp to 40% of device creation operations failed in us-west2, while approximately 1% of snapshot operations were delayed or failed in us-central1, us-east1, us-west-1, and northamerica-northeast2. Existing Persistent Disk devices were not impacted.\nIn addition to fixing the underlying cause, we will be implementing changes to prevent, reduce the impact of, and better communicate about this type of failure in several ways:\n- Enhancing safety checks of our underlying systems.\n- Adding additional mechanisms that allow Google engineers to rapidly determine and fix the root cause of the service disruption.\n- Improve regression testing for ACL components for error conditions.",

      "text": "INCIDENT REPORT\n**Summary:**\nOn Thursday, May 20, 2021 at 05:25 US/Pacific, Google Cloud products experienced elevated latency and/or errors due to an issue with Access Control Lists (ACLs) intermittently for a duration of 10 hours and 45 minutes. The affected ACLs in this instance were internal that are used to define permissions for Google’s internal production resources. This prevented some internal service accounts from accessing various production jobs, which led to the downstream service impact. We apologize to our Cloud customers whose businesses were impacted during this disruption, and we are taking immediate action to improve the resiliency, performance, and availability of our services to avoid a recurrence.\n**Root Cause:**\nGoogle’s datacenters rely on Access Control Lists (ACLs) stored in a highly available lock service to perform operations, including validating permissions, activating new APIs, or creating new cloud resources. The access distribution manager, which maintains ACLs across Google production, encompasses both the control plane systems that allow for users to edit groups and the jobs which write the intended current state into the data plane, which is stored in a lock service as a set of signed ACL files.\nThe incident was triggered by a latent concurrency issue in a component of the production ACL system combined with a missing safety check, which led to truncation of ACLs across a subset of production. The safety mechanism for the legacy ACL components was inadvertently disabled by a change to update to the latest version in a subset of datacenters. The disabled safety checks in the legacy ACL component jobs allowed the invalid ACLs to be processed. The ACL component identified membership removals in the data snapshot and proceeded to remove ACL files from a backend locking service and passed the invalid ACLs to the backend stack, which correctly failed the safety checks.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue by automated alerting on 20 May 2021 at 05:55 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. At 06:07, engineers identified an incomplete data snapshot being written, and a safety check mechanism was unexpectedly removing group memberships. At 06:21, engineers began mitigation efforts to terminate ACL component jobs globally to prevent further impact. To identify the root cause, engineers compared jobs serving affected datacenters and verified they were served by legacy ACL components, while those which were not affected were served using the latest version of safety check flags. The next phase of the mitigation strategy was to restore most critical group memberships that were removed. Simultaneously, the failing ACL component jobs were being configured to apply the correct safety checks and prepared to restart to restore healthy memberships. By 07:32, engineers worked to repair and restore the legacy stack jobs to write the correct ACLs in impacted datacenters. By 07:44, we began manually restoring critical ACLs.\nBy 15:09, most of the production fleet was mitigated and engineers continued to restore the remaining ACLs. At 16:10, the ACL issues across production were fully mitigated.\nWe apologize for the length and severity of this incident. We are taking immediate steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future.\n**Detailed Description of Impact:**\nOn Thursday, May 20, 2021 from 05:25 to 16:10 US/Pacific, Google Cloud Infrastructure components experienced a service disruption which had varying degrees of impact to downstream services as described in detail below:\n**BigQuery**\nExperienced elevated error rates running queries and streaming in europe-west2. Around 5% of projects in the region were impacted with 0.63% failed query jobs and 3% of failed requests for streaming inserts from 06:10 to 07:30 PT.\n**Cloud Data Catalog**\nExperienced elevated error rates (30-40%) with permissions when reading backend databases in europe-west2 from 10:15 PT to 11:35 PT.\n**Cloud Logging**\nExperienced delayed logs in Google Cloud Storage (GCS) export pipeline in europe-west2 from 07:45 to 11:31 PT.\n**Cloud SQL**\nExperienced elevated error rates and latency on Admin APIs in the following regions from 06:51 to 09:44 PT: asia-south2, asia-southeast1, australia-southeast1, europe-north1, europe-west2, europe-west4, europe-west6, northamerica-northeast1, southamerica-east1, us-central1, us-central2, us-east1, us-east4, us-west1 and europe-west1. Among most impacted operations, instance creation (instances.insert) had an error ratio of 69%. Additionally, 10% of successful responses to instance.insert later experienced downstream creation failures. Changes to instance configs (instances.update and instances.patch) had 96% and 87% error rates respectively. Existing instances had no significant connectivity impact. Customers using gcloud sql to connect from new IP addresses that had not yet been added to the ACL, would have been unable to connect.\n**Cloud Bigtable**\nData API experienced elevated latency and error rates up to 10% in europe-west2 from 06:30 to 09:33 PT.\n**Cloud Dataproc**\nExperienced elevated latency of 95% with cluster creation and deletion in europe-west2.\n**Cloud Vertex AI**\nExperienced service degradation in europe-west2 which caused 15% of API requests to fail from 06:57 to 10:28 PT.\n**Cloud AI Platform**\nExperienced up to 100% widespread backend error rates in europe-west2 from 06:15 to 12:40 PT.\n**Cloud Dataflow**\nExperienced jobs stuck in a pending state; jobs were unable to be terminated or cancelled; jobs were unable to migrate backends which resulted in stuck progress; and streaming jobs experienced delays in europe-west2. 35% of projects were impacted in the region from 06:06 to 12:37 PT.\n**Cloud Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**\nUp to 75% of DLP worker tasks were down in europe-west2. 25% error rate averaged across all method types from 10:28 to 11:36 PT.\n**Google Compute Engine (GCE)**\nSome GCE APIs experienced degraded availability and elevated error rates up to 40% in europe-west2 and europe-west3. Customers also experienced delays in VM creation and deletion operations in us-west2-a from 06:50 to 11:48 PT.\n**Cloud Composer**\nExperienced composer environment creation and update operation failures up to 80% globally from 06:08 to 11:07 PT. Existing environments may have experienced service errors.\n**AppEngine Flexible**\nExperienced deployment failures with timeouts or reporting success globally. Approximately 21% of affected projects experienced 503 errors after deploying a new version, and approximately 79% of affected projects experienced deployment deadline exceeded errors from 05:45 to 09:30 PT.\n**Cloud Networking**\nCustomer initiated control plane config changes related to load balancing products were delayed globally from 05:28 PT to 09:15 PT. Creation or changes to existing Network Load Balancers were delayed in europe-west2 (from 06:20 to 10:05 PT) and europe-west3 (from 07:19 to 10:05 PT). Customers who didn't command config changes during the incident were not affected.\n**Cloud Armor**\nNew Cloud Armor configs were delayed globally from 05:35 to 09:15 PT.\n**Cloud Console**\nExperienced elevated error rates up to 100% while accessing some pages of the console. 2.82% of users were impacted globally from 07:03 to 10:00 PT.\n**Artifact Registry**\nExperienced errors for several HTTP-Maven/Docker and ScottyAgent requests in europe-west1 and australia-southeast1 from 06:20 - 09:45 PT.\n**Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**\nExperienced elevated “400” errors up to 95% which were mostly deadline exceeded errors for 3 hours in europe-west2 from 07:25 to 10:22 PT.\n**Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**\nCustomers were unable to create new clusters for around 2 hours in europe-west2 and europe-west3 from 08:20 to 10:10 PT.\n**Identity and Access Management (IAM)**\nEurope-west2: Checkpolicy <0.01% error rate (2-3 qps) from 6:02 to 11:33 PT\nGlobalization Expand RPC served elevated latency everywhere from 6:47 to 10:02 PT.\n**Persistent Disk (PD)**\nUp to 40% of device creation operations failed in us-west2, while approximately 1% of snapshot operations were delayed or failed in us-central1, us-east1, us-west-1, and northamerica-northeast2. Existing Persistent Disk devices were not impacted.\nIn addition to fixing the underlying cause, we will be implementing changes to prevent, reduce the impact of, and better communicate about this type of failure in several ways:\n- Enhancing safety checks of our underlying systems.\n- Adding additional mechanisms that allow Google engineers to rapidly determine and fix the root cause of the service disruption.\n- Improve regression testing for ACL components for error conditions.",

This impacted Internet and Cloud Interconnect connectivity to/from us-west2, including traffic between GCE VMs in the region and Internet endpoints, VM-to-VM traffic over Public IPs, External Network Load Balancing, Cloud VPN Classic (non-HA), and Cloud Interconnect. Cloud VPN HA was not impacted.\n**Root cause and mitigation:**\nThe root cause was a rollout that changed some internal network settings on machines which handle internet routing to Cloud Services. Machines which received the change were unable to receive network programming information. The change caused new TCP connections to establish successfully, but dropped some packets sent between the Control and Data plane (Maglev[1]). Maglevs route traffic from public IPs and interconnects to various endpoints such as Cloud VPN tasks, individual instances, and groups of instances.

This impacted Internet and Cloud Interconnect connectivity to/from us-west2, including traffic between GCE VMs in the region and Internet endpoints, VM-to-VM traffic over Public IPs, External Network Load Balancing, Cloud VPN Classic (non-HA), and Cloud Interconnect. Cloud VPN HA was not impacted.\n**Root cause and mitigation:**\nThe root cause was a rollout that changed some internal network settings on machines which handle internet routing to Cloud Services. Machines which received the change were unable to receive network programming information. The change caused new TCP connections to establish successfully, but dropped some packets sent between the Control and Data plane (Maglev[1]). Maglevs route traffic from public IPs and interconnects to various endpoints such as Cloud VPN tasks, individual instances, and groups of instances. When a Maglev task first starts, it must be programmed in order to start routing traffic. As independent Maglev Control and Dataplane rollouts restarted tasks, their long-standing TCP connections were reset, and the newly established connections were unable to exchange programming messages. This was mitigated by rolling back the configuration change once the root cause was identified.\n[1] https://research.google/pubs/pub44824\n**Customer Impact:**\n* There were two impact windows, with minor impact from 15:35 to 17:50, and major impact from 17:50 to 21:08.\n* GCE and GKE experienced up to 50% egress and ingress traffic loss in us-west2 for traffic over public IP.

        "text": "# ISSUE SUMMARY\nOn Wednesday 17 March 2021, Google Cloud Networking and Cloud Services that depend on Google's backbone network experienced a service disruption that resulted in increased latency, packet loss, and service unavailable errors for some services for a duration of 3 hours, 39 minutes. Cloud Interconnect had an extended impact duration of 4 hours, 30 minutes. We understand that this issue has impacted our valued customers and users, and we apologize to those who were affected.\n# ROOT CAUSE\nGoogle Cloud datacenters connect to Google’s global Backbone network through a datacenter edge networking stack that uses routers to bridge a region’s network with the global Backbone network. There are multiple roles that routers in Google networks have; some routers are dedicated to providing connectivity to the Google Backbone network, others are dedicated to providing aggregation for customer and peering routes. Google utilizes routers from multiple vendors to provide defense in depth in order to reduce impact for issues that affect a specific router vendor.\nThe trigger for this service disruption was a new set of routers being connected to Google’s backbone network as part of the normal router build process. The routers were part of a new network topology, this topology changed routes that some router roles received. This change in topology inadvertently caused the associated routes to be communicated to routers responsible for providing connectivity to the Google backbone, as well as aggregation routers. This triggered a defect in routers of a specific model, causing their routing process to fail. We previously communicated this defect was unknown; this is incorrect, as after further investigation we found that this defect was previously known, however it was not known to affect routers in these roles. During a routing failure these routers are configured to automatically redirect traffic away to minimize congestion and traffic loss, however, this results in some packet loss while the network reconverges onto new paths. This behavior worked as intended to reduce the potential impact of the issue, as repeated widespread routing process failures have the potential to create cascade failures in the backbone network.\n# REMEDIATION AND PREVENTION\nOnce the nature and scope of the problem became clear, Google engineers isolated the new set of routers from the network to prevent invalid routes being sent to the backbone routers. Once it was confirmed that affected routers were healthy and no longer had invalid routes, and impact for most services had ended, engineers began work to return traffic back to the routers that had rebooted. During this mitigation work to return traffic to a large number of routers, congestion caused a temporary period of increased loss and latency. Once the rebooted routers were back in the traffic path and the network had reconverged, the incident was considered mitigated.\nIn addition to fixing the underlying cause that resulted in invalid routes to trigger routing process failures on specific routers and repairing the bug in the vendor OS, we will be implementing changes to prevent and reduce the impact of this type of failure in several ways:\n1\\. Improve internal tooling for redirecting traffic from routers to reduce time to mitigation for issues with widespread network impact.\n2\\. Improve testing and release process of new router builds to ensure that topology changes for router roles are identified prior to being connected to the backbone network.\nIn addition to these changes, we are also working on long term architectural changes to help prevent issues of this type in the future. These changes will create well defined functional domains in the backbone network to allow for more consistent enforcement of route policies, limiting the scale of potential impact. These policies would provide better systematic protection against routes propagated through the network.\n# DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF IMPACT\nOn Wednesday 17 March 2021 from 08:20 to 12:50 US/Pacific, Google Cloud Networking increased latency, packet loss, and service unavailable errors for traffic between regions and from Google to external endpoints including on-premises environments and the public internet. The issue was mitigated when the source of the invalid routes was isolated by 11:00, and work to redirect traffic back to the affected routers began. During this time, the manual one-time mitigation to return traffic to a large number of routers caused a temporary period of congestion, leading to increased loss and latency between 11:13 and 11:24. Additionally, a set of faulty routers in us-east4 incorrectly had traffic routed to them as part of this mitigation work, which resulted in further impact to the network in that region between 11:08 and 11:59. Finally, Cloud Interconnect had extended impact until 12:50 due to a lack of router vendor redundancy in some interconnect locations.\n#### Compute Engine\nVM to VM inter-regional traffic via public IP’s experienced intermittent packet loss with peaks of up to 42.6%. VM to VM inter-regional traffic via private IP’s experienced intermittent packet loss with peaks of up to 15.6%. Connectivity within a zone was not impacted. The period of impact was between 08:20 and 11:59.\n#### Cloud Load Balancing\nRequests to Cloud load balancers and Cloud CDN experienced increased timeouts, errors of up to 25%, and additional latency between 08:20 and 10:43.\n#### Cloud Interconnect\nCloud interconnect experienced intermittent packet loss for interconnects, with peaks of up to 100% loss lasting several minutes between 08:20 and 12:50. Some interconnect locations did not have sufficient vendor redundancy for routers, resulting in a longer period of impact during traffic redirection.\n#### Cloud VPN\nUp to 13.5% of Cloud VPN tunnels experienced intermittent connectivity loss between 08:29 and 10:46.\n#### Kubernetes Engine\nZonal clusters were impacted due to the impact to Cloud Networking and Compute Engine and experienced increased latency, errors, and packet loss for requests to the Kubernetes control plane. Regional clusters were unaffected due to master node redundancy.\n#### App Engine Flex\nSome App Engine Flex traffic experienced increased latency during the incident.\n#### Cloud Spanner\nCloud Spanner experienced increased latency and increased DEADLINE_EXCEEDED errors in us-central1, us-east1, and europe-west1 from 08:50 to 11:45.\n# ADDITIONAL DETAILS\nThe end time used in the preliminary incident statement was incorrect, as some services had lingering impact after the issue was mitigated. The corrected details for impact times are contained in the above report.",

        "text": "# ISSUE SUMMARY\nOn Friday, 12 February 2021, Google Cloud Networking experienced elevated packet loss for newly created, updated, deleted or migrated virtual machines (VMs) and network endpoints for a duration of 4 hours, 4 minutes. Network programming for VMs and network endpoints was also affected for the duration. To our customers whose businesses were impacted during this service disruption, we sincerely apologize – this is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n# ROOT CAUSE\nGoogle Cloud's networking control plane has global components that are responsible for fanning-out network configurations that can affect an entire Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network to downstream (regional/zonal) networking controllers. Work has been ongoing to better isolate global networking control plane components to limit scope of impact for issues that affect these global components. Cloud Networking also relies on a suite of automation tools to manage and enforce the quota of resources allocated to VPC networks. Some quotas are enforced with logic that will automatically remove resources when the quota is decreased, and reprocess previous resource operations when quota is increased.\nThe circumstances that led to this was a latent issue in the control plane quota enforcement logic. During routine handling of peering quota change requests, previous operations that were rejected due to a lack of available quota were being re-evaluated and re-processed by the networking control plane. While doing this re-evaluation, the networking control plane encountered the latent issue and could not process other incoming network programming operations, triggering timeouts for those requests. As VPC resources are multi-regional in nature, this also meant that newly created, updated, deleted or migrated VM resources in regions that required programming on the network control plane were not able to establish connectivity, resulting in elevated packet loss.\n# REMEDIATION AND PREVENTION\nOnce the nature and scope of the issue became clear, Google engineers paused VM migrations globally to prevent existing instances from being impacted. Networking quota changes were also paused to prevent a recurrence until a fix had been rolled out. The issue trigger was isolated to update operations, not initial load operations, so a rolling restart of the networking control plane was triggered to mitigate the issue. Teams worked through the weekend to ensure that recurrence was not possible by rolling out a fix globally.\nIn addition to fixing the underlying cause, we will be implementing changes to prevent and reduce the impact of this type of failure in several ways:\n1\\. Add health checks and automated restarts when the networking control plane responsible for peering operations becomes unresponsive\n2\\. Continue work to regionalize network control plane components to reduce scope of impact for future issues of this type\n3\\. Automatically pause VM migrations when high numbers of VMs are exhibiting networking issues\n4\\. Improve monitoring of network control plane operations to decrease time to mitigation for issues of this type\n5\\. Improve networking data plane resilience when the networking control plane is unresponsive\n# DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF IMPACT\nOn Friday 12 February, 2021 from 14:51 to 18:55 US/Pacific, Cloud Networking control plane operations experienced increased error rates, and experienced elevated packet loss for both inter- and intra-region traffic.\n#### Cloud Networking\nElevated control plane operation error rates of up to 15% in most regions except for us-central1. Region us-central1 experienced elevated control plane error rates of up to 50% between 15:00 and 16:15, dropping to values similar to other regions by 16:45. VM to VM traffic experienced up to 2.5% packet loss for intra-region traffic, and up to 3.5% loss for inter-region traffic.\n#### Cloud VPN\n1.4% of Cloud VPN tunnels in us-central1 lost connectivity from 15:12 to 17:00.\n#### Cloud Interconnect\nChanges to Cloud Interconnect resources experienced delayed propagation or failures during the incident.\n#### Compute Engine (GCE)\nNewly created, updated, deleted or migrated VMs failed to have networking set up during the incident. Existing instances that were not migrated or updated during the incident were not impacted.\n#### Kubernetes Engine (GKE)\nApproximately 1000 clusters were affected by the inability to provision new clusters or nodes. Node availability was impacted due to the impact to Cloud Networking and GCE instances for the duration of the incident.\n#### Cloud Dataproc\nCluster creation and update operations that created new nodes experienced failures during the incident due to the impact to GCE VM networking.\n#### Cloud Shell\nCloud Shell users assigned to us-central1 were unable to connect to Cloud Shell. Existing sessions were unaffected.\n#### Cloud SQL\n6.3% of instance creation operations failed globally between 14:55 and 17:52. Maintenance operations failed or timed out during the incident, but did not impact data plane availability on existing instances. Replica creation during the incident resulted in instances in a failed state, and were automatically recovered within 24 hours.\n#### Cloud Memorystore\nUp to 100% of instance creations failed between 15:15 and 18:20. Instances that were being live-migrated came up on new hosts without networking and faced connectivity issues until they recovered automatically.\n#### Cloud Data Fusion\nCloud Data Fusion instance creations failed during the incident due to failure to create GKE and Cloud SQL instances.\n#### Filestore\nA small number of Filestore instances were live-migrated during the incident. These newly migrated instances lost networking after the live migration before recovering on their own.\n#### Cloud Load Balancing\nCreate and update requests for global L7 external load balancers experienced up to 98% error rate between 15:17 and 18:15, and error rates up to 50% between 18:15 and 18:33. Create and update requests for regional L7 internal load balancers experienced up to 10% error rates, with us-central1 experiencing up to 70% error rates between 15:10 and 17:02.\n#### App Engine Flex\nUp to 80% of new deployments to App Engine Flex failed during the incident.",

      "text": "# ISSUE SUMMARY\nOn Friday, 12 February 2021, Google Cloud Networking experienced elevated packet loss for newly created, updated, deleted or migrated virtual machines (VMs) and network endpoints for a duration of 4 hours, 4 minutes. Network programming for VMs and network endpoints was also affected for the duration. To our customers whose businesses were impacted during this service disruption, we sincerely apologize – this is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n# ROOT CAUSE\nGoogle Cloud's networking control plane has global components that are responsible for fanning-out network configurations that can affect an entire Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network to downstream (regional/zonal) networking controllers. Work has been ongoing to better isolate global networking control plane components to limit scope of impact for issues that affect these global components. Cloud Networking also relies on a suite of automation tools to manage and enforce the quota of resources allocated to VPC networks. Some quotas are enforced with logic that will automatically remove resources when the quota is decreased, and reprocess previous resource operations when quota is increased.\nThe circumstances that led to this was a latent issue in the control plane quota enforcement logic. During routine handling of peering quota change requests, previous operations that were rejected due to a lack of available quota were being re-evaluated and re-processed by the networking control plane. While doing this re-evaluation, the networking control plane encountered the latent issue and could not process other incoming network programming operations, triggering timeouts for those requests. As VPC resources are multi-regional in nature, this also meant that newly created, updated, deleted or migrated VM resources in regions that required programming on the network control plane were not able to establish connectivity, resulting in elevated packet loss.\n# REMEDIATION AND PREVENTION\nOnce the nature and scope of the issue became clear, Google engineers paused VM migrations globally to prevent existing instances from being impacted. Networking quota changes were also paused to prevent a recurrence until a fix had been rolled out. The issue trigger was isolated to update operations, not initial load operations, so a rolling restart of the networking control plane was triggered to mitigate the issue. Teams worked through the weekend to ensure that recurrence was not possible by rolling out a fix globally.\nIn addition to fixing the underlying cause, we will be implementing changes to prevent and reduce the impact of this type of failure in several ways:\n1\\. Add health checks and automated restarts when the networking control plane responsible for peering operations becomes unresponsive\n2\\. Continue work to regionalize network control plane components to reduce scope of impact for future issues of this type\n3\\. Automatically pause VM migrations when high numbers of VMs are exhibiting networking issues\n4\\. Improve monitoring of network control plane operations to decrease time to mitigation for issues of this type\n5\\. Improve networking data plane resilience when the networking control plane is unresponsive\n# DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF IMPACT\nOn Friday 12 February, 2021 from 14:51 to 18:55 US/Pacific, Cloud Networking control plane operations experienced increased error rates, and experienced elevated packet loss for both inter- and intra-region traffic.\n#### Cloud Networking\nElevated control plane operation error rates of up to 15% in most regions except for us-central1. Region us-central1 experienced elevated control plane error rates of up to 50% between 15:00 and 16:15, dropping to values similar to other regions by 16:45. VM to VM traffic experienced up to 2.5% packet loss for intra-region traffic, and up to 3.5% loss for inter-region traffic.\n#### Cloud VPN\n1.4% of Cloud VPN tunnels in us-central1 lost connectivity from 15:12 to 17:00.\n#### Cloud Interconnect\nChanges to Cloud Interconnect resources experienced delayed propagation or failures during the incident.\n#### Compute Engine (GCE)\nNewly created, updated, deleted or migrated VMs failed to have networking set up during the incident. Existing instances that were not migrated or updated during the incident were not impacted.\n#### Kubernetes Engine (GKE)\nApproximately 1000 clusters were affected by the inability to provision new clusters or nodes. Node availability was impacted due to the impact to Cloud Networking and GCE instances for the duration of the incident.\n#### Cloud Dataproc\nCluster creation and update operations that created new nodes experienced failures during the incident due to the impact to GCE VM networking.\n#### Cloud Shell\nCloud Shell users assigned to us-central1 were unable to connect to Cloud Shell. Existing sessions were unaffected.\n#### Cloud SQL\n6.3% of instance creation operations failed globally between 14:55 and 17:52. Maintenance operations failed or timed out during the incident, but did not impact data plane availability on existing instances. Replica creation during the incident resulted in instances in a failed state, and were automatically recovered within 24 hours.\n#### Cloud Memorystore\nUp to 100% of instance creations failed between 15:15 and 18:20. Instances that were being live-migrated came up on new hosts without networking and faced connectivity issues until they recovered automatically.\n#### Cloud Data Fusion\nCloud Data Fusion instance creations failed during the incident due to failure to create GKE and Cloud SQL instances.\n#### Filestore\nA small number of Filestore instances were live-migrated during the incident. These newly migrated instances lost networking after the live migration before recovering on their own.\n#### Cloud Load Balancing\nCreate and update requests for global L7 external load balancers experienced up to 98% error rate between 15:17 and 18:15, and error rates up to 50% between 18:15 and 18:33. Create and update requests for regional L7 internal load balancers experienced up to 10% error rates, with us-central1 experiencing up to 70% error rates between 15:10 and 17:02.\n#### App Engine Flex\nUp to 80% of new deployments to App Engine Flex failed during the incident.",

        "text": "# ISSUE SUMMARY\nOn Monday 14 December, 2020, for a duration of 47 minutes, customer-facing Google services that required Google OAuth access were unavailable. Cloud Service accounts used by GCP workloads were not impacted and continued to function. We apologize to our customers whose services or businesses were impacted during this incident, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n# ROOT CAUSE\nThe Google User ID Service maintains a unique identifier for every account and handles authentication credentials for OAuth tokens and cookies. It stores account data in a distributed database, which uses Paxos protocols to coordinate updates. For security reasons, this service will reject requests when it detects outdated data.\nGoogle uses an evolving suite of automation tools to manage the quota of various resources allocated for services. As part of an ongoing migration of the User ID Service to a new quota system, a change was made in October to register the User ID Service with the new quota system, but parts of the previous quota system were left in place which incorrectly reported the usage for the User ID Service as 0. An existing grace period on enforcing quota restrictions delayed the impact, which eventually expired, triggering automated quota systems to decrease the quota allowed for the User ID service and triggering this incident. Existing safety checks exist to prevent many unintended quota changes, but at the time they did not cover the scenario of zero reported load for a single service:\n• Quota changes to large number of users, since only a single group was the target of the change,\n• Lowering quota below usage, since the reported usage was inaccurately being reported as zero,\n• Excessive quota reduction to storage systems, since no alert fired during the grace period,\n• Low quota, since the difference between usage and quota exceeded the protection limit.\nAs a result, the quota for the account database was reduced, which prevented the Paxos leader from writing. Shortly after, the majority of read operations became outdated which resulted in errors on authentication lookups.\n# REMEDIATION AND PREVENTION\nThe scope of the problem was immediately clear as the new quotas took effect. This was detected by automated alerts for capacity at 2020-12-14 03:43 US/Pacific, and for errors with the User ID Service starting at 03:46, which paged Google Engineers at 03:48 within one minute of customer impact. At 04:08 the root cause and a potential fix were identified, which led to disabling the quota enforcement in one datacenter at 04:22. This quickly improved the situation, and at 04:27 the same mitigation was applied to all datacenters, which returned error rates to normal levels by 04:33. As outlined below, some user services took longer to fully recover.\nIn addition to fixing the underlying cause, we will be implementing changes to prevent, reduce the impact of, and better communicate about this type of failure in several ways:\n1\\. Review our quota management automation to prevent fast implementation of global changes\n2\\. Improve monitoring and alerting to catch incorrect configurations sooner\n3\\. Improve reliability of tools and procedures for posting external communications during outages that affect internal tools\n4\\. Evaluate and implement improved write failure resilience into our User ID service database\n5\\. Improve resilience of GCP Services to more strictly limit the impact to the data plane during User ID Service failures\nWe would like to apologize for the scope of impact that this incident had on our customers and their businesses. We take any incident that affects the availability and reliability of our customers extremely seriously, particularly incidents which span multiple regions. We are conducting a thorough investigation of the incident and will be making the changes which result from that investigation our top priority in Google Engineering.\n# DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF IMPACT\nOn Monday 14 December, 2020 from 03:46 to 04:33 US/Pacific, credential issuance and account metadata lookups for all Google user accounts failed. As a result, we could not verify that user requests were authenticated and served 5xx errors on virtually all authenticated traffic. The majority of authenticated services experienced similar control plane impact: elevated error rates across all Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace APIs and Consoles. Products continued to deliver service normally during the incident except where specifically called out below. Most services recovered automatically within a short period of time after the main issue ended at 04:33. Some services had unique or lingering impact, which is detailed below.\n#### Cloud Console\nAny users who hadn't already previously authenticated to Cloud Console were unable to login. Users who had already authenticated may have been able to use Cloud Console but may have seen some features degraded.\n#### Google BigQuery\nDuring the incident, streaming requests returned ~75% errors, while BigQuery jobs returned ~10% errors on average globally.\n#### Google Cloud Storage\nApproximately 15% of requests to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) were impacted during the outage, specifically those using OAuth, HMAC or email authentication. After 2020-12-14 04:31 US/Pacific, the majority of impact was resolved, however, there was lingering impact, for <1% of clients that attempted to finalize resumable uploads that started during the window. These uploads were left in a non-resumable state; the error code GCS returned was retryable, but subsequent retries were unable to make progress, leaving these objects unfinalized.\n#### Google Cloud Networking\nThe networking control plane continued to see elevated error rates on operations until it fully recovered at 2020-12-14 05:21 US/Pacific. Only operations that made modifications to the data plane VPC network were impacted. All existing configurations in the data plane remained operational.\n#### Google Kubernetes Engine\nDuring the incident, ~4% of requests to the GKE control plane API failed, and nearly all Google-managed and customer workloads could not report metrics to Cloud Monitoring.\nWe believe ~5% of requests to Kubernetes control planes failed but do not have accurate measures due to unreported Cloud Monitoring metrics.\nFor up to an hour after the outage, ~1.9% nodes reported conditions such as StartGracePeriod or NetworkUnavailable which may have had an impact on user workloads.\n#### Google Workspace\nAll Google Workspace services rely on Google's account infrastructure for login, authentication, and enforcement of access control on resources (e.g. documents, Calendar events, Gmail messages). As a consequence, all authenticated Google Workspace apps were down for the duration of the incident. After the issue was mitigated at 2020-12-14 04:32 US/Pacific, Google Workspace apps recovered, and most services were fully recovered by 05:00. Some services, including Google Calendar and Google Workspace Admin Console, served errors up to 05:21 due to a traffic spike following initial recovery. Some Gmail users experienced errors for up to an hour after recovery due to caching of errors from identity services.\n#### Cloud Support\nCloud Support's internal tools were impacted, which delayed our ability to share outage communications with customers on the Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace Status Dashboards. Customers were unable to create or view cases in the Cloud Console. We were able to update customers at 2020-12-14 05:34 US/Pacific after the impact had ended.",

        "text": "# ISSUE SUMMARY\nOn Wednesday 9 December, 2020, Google Cloud Platform experienced networking unavailability in zone europe-west2-a, resulting in some customers being unable to access their resources, for a duration of 1 hour 24 minutes. The following Google services had degraded service that extended beyond the initial 1 hour 24 minute network disruption:\n- 1.5% of Cloud Memorystore Redis instances were unhealthy for a total duration of 2 hours 24 minutes\n- 4.5% of Classic Cloud VPN tunnels in the europe-west2 region experienced unavailability after the main disruption had recovered and these tunnels remained down for a duration of 8 hours and 10 minutes\n- App Engine Flex experienced increased deployment error rates for a total duration of 1 hour 45 minutes\nWe apologize to our Cloud customers who were impacted during this disruption. We have conducted a thorough internal investigation and are taking immediate action to improve the resiliency and availability of our service.\n# ROOT CAUSE\nGoogle’s underlying networking control plane consists of multiple distributed components that make up the Software Defined Networking (SDN) stack. These components run on multiple machines so that failure of a machine or even multiple machines does not impact network capacity. To achieve this, the control plane elects a leader from a pool of machines to provide configuration to the various infrastructure components. The leader election process depends on a local instance of Google’s internal lock service to read various configurations and files for determining the leader. The control plane is responsible for Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) peering sessions between physical routers connecting a cloud zone to the Google backbone.\nGoogle’s internal lock service provides Access Control List (ACLs) mechanisms to control reading and writing of various files stored in the service. A change to the ACLs used by the network control plane caused the tasks responsible for leader election to no longer have access to the files required for the process. The production environment contained ACLs not present in the staging or canary environments due to those environments being rebuilt using updated processes during previous maintenance events. This meant that some of the ACLs removed in the change were in use in europe-west2-a, and the validation of the configuration change in testing and canary environments did not surface the issue.\nGoogle's resilience strategy relies on the principle of defense in depth. Specifically, despite the network control infrastructure being designed to be highly resilient, the network is designed to 'fail static' and run for a period of time without the control plane being present as an additional line of defense against failure. The network ran normally for a short period - several minutes - after the control plane had been unable to elect a leader task. After this period, BGP routing between europe-west2-a and the rest of the Google backbone network was withdrawn, resulting in isolation of the zone and inaccessibility of resources in the zone.\n# REMEDIATION AND PREVENTION\nGoogle engineers were automatically alerted to elevated error rates in europe-west2-a at 2020-12-09 18:29 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. The configuration change rollout was automatically halted as soon as the issue was detected, preventing it from reaching any other zones. At 19:30, mitigation was applied to rollback the configuration change in europe-west2-a. This completed at 19:55, mitigating the immediate issue. Some services such as Cloud MemoryStore and Cloud VPN took additional time to recover due to complications arising from the initial disruption. Services with extended recovery timelines are described in the “detailed description of impact” section below.\nWe are committed to preventing this situation from happening again and are implementing the following actions:\nIn addition to rolling back the configuration change responsible for this disruption, we are auditing all network ACLs to ensure they are consistent across environments. While the network continued to operate for a short time after the change was rolled out, we are improving the operating mode of the data plane when the control plane is unavailable for extended periods. Improvements in visibility to recent changes will be made to reduce the time to mitigation. Additional observability will be added to lock service ACLs allowing for additional validation when making changes to ACLs. We are also improving the canary and release process for future changes of this type to ensure these changes are made safely.\n# DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF IMPACT\nOn Wednesday 9 December, 2020 from 18:31 to 19:55 US/Pacific Google Cloud experienced unavailability for some Google services hosted in zone europe-west2-a as described in detail below. If impact time differs significantly, it will be mentioned specifically.\n## Compute Engine\n~60% of VMs in europe-west2-a were unreachable from outside the zone. Projects affected by this incident would have observed 100% of VMs in the zone being unreachable. Communication within the zone had minor issues, but largely worked normally. VM creation and deletion operations were stalled during the outage. VMs on hosts that had hardware or other faults during the outage were not repaired and restarted onto healthy hosts during the outage.\n## Persistent Disk\nVMs in europe-west2-a experienced stuck I/O operations for 59% of standard persistent disks located in that zone. 27% of regional persistent disks in europe-west2 briefly experienced high I/O latency at the start and end of the incident. Persistent Disk snapshot creation and restore for 59% of disks located in europe-west2-a failed during the incident. Additionally, snapshot creation for Regional Persistent Disks with one replica located in zone europe-west2-a was unavailable.\n## Cloud SQL\n~79% of HA Cloud SQL instances experienced <5 minutes of downtime due to autofailover with an additional ~5% experiencing <25m of downtime after manual recovery. ~13% of HA Cloud SQL instances with legacy HA configuration did not failover because the replicas were out of sync, and were unreachable for the full duration of the incident. The remaining HA Cloud SQL instances did not failover due to stuck operations. Overall, 97.5% of Regional PD based HA instances and 23% of legacy MySQL HA instances had <25m downtime with the remaining instances being unconnectable during the outage. Google engineering is committed to improving the successful failover rate for Cloud SQL HA instances for zonal outages like this.\n## Google App Engine\nApp Engine Flex apps in europe-west2 experienced increased deployment error rates between 10% and 100% from 18:44 to 20:29.\nApp Engine Standard apps running in the europe-west2 region experienced increased deployment error rates of up to 9.6% that lasted from 18:38 to 18:47. ~34.7% of App Engine Standard apps in the region experienced increased serving error rates between 18:32 and 18:38.\n## Cloud Functions\n34.8% of Cloud Functions served from europe-west2 experienced increased serving error rates between 18:32 and 18:38.\n## Cloud Run\n54.8% of Cloud Run apps served from europe-west2 experienced increased serving error rates between 18:32 and 18:38.\n## Cloud MemoryStore\n~10% of Redis instances in europe-west2, were unreachable during the outage. Both standard tier and basic tier instances were affected. After the main outage was mitigated, most instances recovered, but ~1.5% of instances remained unhealthy for 60 minutes before recovering on their own.\n## Cloud Filestore\n~16% of Filestore instances in europe-west2 were unhealthy. Instances in the zone were unreachable from outside the zone, but access within the zone was largely unaffected.\n## Cloud Bigtable\n100% of single-homed Cloud Bigtable instances in europe-west2-a were unavailable during the outage, translating into 100% error rate for customer instances located in this zone.\n## Kubernetes Engine\n~67% of cluster control planes in europe-west2-a and 10% of regional clusters in europe-west2 were unavailable for the duration of the incident. Investigation into the regional cluster control plane unavailability is still ongoing. Node creation and deletion operations were stalled due to the impact to Compute Engine operations.\n## Cloud Interconnect\nElevated packet loss for zones in europe-west2. Starting at 18:31 packets destined for resources in europe-west2-a experienced loss for the duration of the incident. Additionally, interconnect attachments in europe-west2 experienced regional loss for 7 minutes at 18:31 and 8 minutes at 19:53.\n## Cloud Dataflow\n~10% of jobs in europe-west2 failed or got stuck in cancellation during the outage. ~40% of Dataflow Streaming Engine jobs in the region were degraded over the course of the incident.\n## Cloud VPN\nA number of Cloud VPN tunnels were reset during the disruption and were automatically relocated to other zones in the region. This is within the design of the product, as the loss of one zone is planned. However once zone europe-west2-a reconnected to the network, a combination of bugs in the VPN control plane were triggered by some of the now stale VPN gateways in the zone. This caused an outage to 4.5% of Classic Cloud VPN tunnels in europe-west2 for a duration of 8 hours and 10 minutes after the main disruption had recovered.\n## Cloud Dataproc\n~0.01% of Dataproc API requests to europe-west2 returned UNAVAILABLE during the incident. The majority of these requests were read-only requests (ListClusters, ListJobs, etc.)\n# SLA CREDITS\nIf you believe your paid application experienced an SLA violation as a result of this incident, please submit the SLA credit request: https://support.google.com/cloud/contact/cloud_platform_sla\nA full list of all Google Cloud Platform Service Level Agreements can be found at https://cloud.google.com/terms/sla/",

The following Google services had degraded service that extended beyond the initial 1 hour 24 minute network disruption:\n- 1.5% of Cloud Memorystore Redis instances were unhealthy for a total duration of 2 hours 24 minutes\n- 4.5% of Classic Cloud VPN tunnels in the europe-west2 region experienced unavailability after the main disruption had recovered and these tunnels remained down for a duration of 8 hours and 10 minutes\n- App Engine Flex experienced increased deployment error rates for a total duration of 1 hour 45 minutes\nWe apologize to our Cloud customers who were impacted during this disruption. We have conducted a thorough internal investigation and are taking immediate action to improve the resiliency and availability of our service.\n# ROOT CAUSE\nGoogle’s underlying networking control plane consists of multiple distributed components that make up the Software Defined Networking (SDN) stack. These components run on multiple machines so that failure of a machine or even multiple machines does not impact network capacity. To achieve this, the control plane elects a leader from a pool of machines to provide configuration to the various infrastructure components. The leader election process depends on a local instance of Google’s internal lock service to read various configurations and files for determining the leader. The control plane is responsible for Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) peering sessions between physical routers connecting a cloud zone to the Google backbone.\nGoogle’s internal lock service provides Access Control List (ACLs) mechanisms to control reading and writing of various files stored in the service. A change to the ACLs used by the network control plane caused the tasks responsible for leader election to no longer have access to the files required for the process. The production environment contained ACLs not present in the staging or canary environments due to those environments being rebuilt using updated processes during previous maintenance events. This meant that some of the ACLs removed in the change were in use in europe-west2-a, and the validation of the configuration change in testing and canary environments did not surface the issue.\nGoogle's resilience strategy relies on the principle of defense in depth. Specifically, despite the network control infrastructure being designed to be highly resilient, the network is designed to 'fail static' and run for a period of time without the control plane being present as an additional line of defense against failure. The network ran normally for a short period - several minutes - after the control plane had been unable to elect a leader task. After this period, BGP routing between europe-west2-a and the rest of the Google backbone network was withdrawn, resulting in isolation of the zone and inaccessibility of resources in the zone.\n# REMEDIATION AND PREVENTION\nGoogle engineers were automatically alerted to elevated error rates in europe-west2-a at 2020-12-09 18:29 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. The configuration change rollout was automatically halted as soon as the issue was detected, preventing it from reaching any other zones. At 19:30, mitigation was applied to rollback the configuration change in europe-west2-a. This completed at 19:55, mitigating the immediate issue. Some services such as Cloud MemoryStore and Cloud VPN took additional time to recover due to complications arising from the initial disruption. Services with extended recovery timelines are described in the “detailed description of impact” section below.\nWe are committed to preventing this situation from happening again and are implementing the following actions:\nIn addition to rolling back the configuration change responsible for this disruption, we are auditing all network ACLs to ensure they are consistent across environments. While the network continued to operate for a short time after the change was rolled out, we are improving the operating mode of the data plane when the control plane is unavailable for extended periods. Improvements in visibility to recent changes will be made to reduce the time to mitigation. Additional observability will be added to lock service ACLs allowing for additional validation when making changes to ACLs. We are also improving the canary and release process for future changes of this type to ensure these changes are made safely.\n# DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF IMPACT\nOn Wednesday 9 December, 2020 from 18:31 to 19:55 US/Pacific Google Cloud experienced unavailability for some Google services hosted in zone europe-west2-a as described in detail below. If impact time differs significantly, it will be mentioned specifically.\n## Compute Engine\n~60% of VMs in europe-west2-a were unreachable from outside the zone. Projects affected by this incident would have observed 100% of VMs in the zone being unreachable. Communication within the zone had minor issues, but largely worked normally. VM creation and deletion operations were stalled during the outage. VMs on hosts that had hardware or other faults during the outage were not repaired and restarted onto healthy hosts during the outage.\n## Persistent Disk\nVMs in europe-west2-a experienced stuck I/O operations for 59% of standard persistent disks located in that zone. 27% of regional persistent disks in europe-west2 briefly experienced high I/O latency at the start and end of the incident. Persistent Disk snapshot creation and restore for 59% of disks located in europe-west2-a failed during the incident. Additionally, snapshot creation for Regional Persistent Disks with one replica located in zone europe-west2-a was unavailable.\n## Cloud SQL\n~79% of HA Cloud SQL instances experienced <5 minutes of downtime due to autofailover with an additional ~5% experiencing <25m of downtime after manual recovery. ~13% of HA Cloud SQL instances with legacy HA configuration did not failover because the replicas were out of sync, and were unreachable for the full duration of the incident. The remaining HA Cloud SQL instances did not failover due to stuck operations. Overall, 97.5% of Regional PD based HA instances and 23% of legacy MySQL HA instances had <25m downtime with the remaining instances being unconnectable during the outage. Google engineering is committed to improving the successful failover rate for Cloud SQL HA instances for zonal outages like this.\n## Google App Engine\nApp Engine Flex apps in europe-west2 experienced increased deployment error rates between 10% and 100% from 18:44 to 20:29.\nApp Engine Standard apps running in the europe-west2 region experienced increased deployment error rates of up to 9.6% that lasted from 18:38 to 18:47. ~34.7% of App Engine Standard apps in the region experienced increased serving error rates between 18:32 and 18:38.\n## Cloud Functions\n34.8% of Cloud Functions served from europe-west2 experienced increased serving error rates between 18:32 and 18:38.\n## Cloud Run\n54.8% of Cloud Run apps served from europe-west2 experienced increased serving error rates between 18:32 and 18:38.\n## Cloud MemoryStore\n~10% of Redis instances in europe-west2, were unreachable during the outage. Both standard tier and basic tier instances were affected. After the main outage was mitigated, most instances recovered, but ~1.5% of instances remained unhealthy for 60 minutes before recovering on their own.\n## Cloud Filestore\n~16% of Filestore instances in europe-west2 were unhealthy. Instances in the zone were unreachable from outside the zone, but access within the zone was largely unaffected.\n## Cloud Bigtable\n100% of single-homed Cloud Bigtable instances in europe-west2-a were unavailable during the outage, translating into 100% error rate for customer instances located in this zone.\n## Kubernetes Engine\n~67% of cluster control planes in europe-west2-a and 10% of regional clusters in europe-west2 were unavailable for the duration of the incident. Investigation into the regional cluster control plane unavailability is still ongoing. Node creation and deletion operations were stalled due to the impact to Compute Engine operations.\n## Cloud Interconnect\nElevated packet loss for zones in europe-west2. Starting at 18:31 packets destined for resources in europe-west2-a experienced loss for the duration of the incident. Additionally, interconnect attachments in europe-west2 experienced regional loss for 7 minutes at 18:31 and 8 minutes at 19:53.\n## Cloud Dataflow\n~10% of jobs in europe-west2 failed or got stuck in cancellation during the outage. ~40% of Dataflow Streaming Engine jobs in the region were degraded over the course of the incident.\n## Cloud VPN\nA number of Cloud VPN tunnels were reset during the disruption and were automatically relocated to other zones in the region. This is within the design of the product, as the loss of one zone is planned. However once zone europe-west2-a reconnected to the network, a combination of bugs in the VPN control plane were triggered by some of the now stale VPN gateways in the zone. This caused an outage to 4.5% of Classic Cloud VPN tunnels in europe-west2 for a duration of 8 hours and 10 minutes after the main disruption had recovered.\n## Cloud Dataproc\n~0.01% of Dataproc API requests to europe-west2 returned UNAVAILABLE during the incident. The majority of these requests were read-only requests (ListClusters, ListJobs, etc.)\n# SLA CREDITS\nIf you believe your paid application experienced an SLA violation as a result of this incident, please submit the SLA credit request: https://support.google.com/cloud/contact/cloud_platform_sla\nA full list of all Google Cloud Platform Service Level Agreements can be found at https://cloud.google.com/terms/sla/",
