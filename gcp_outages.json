        "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn 16 May 2024, the Google Infrastructure team was executing a routine maintenance action to shut down an unused Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) controller in a single Google Cloud zone. Unfortunately, a bug in the automation caused the component to be shut down in all zones where it was still in use. This resulted in networking connectivity issues and/or service disruptions for multiple Google Cloud products. The majority of the impact lasted 2 hours and 48 minutes.\nSome products took longer to fully recover based on the failures they experienced as outlined below in the impact section. To our Google Cloud customers, whose services were impacted, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe root cause was a bug in maintenance automation intended to shut down an unused VPC Controller in a single zone. A parameter specifying the zone for maintenance operations was modified during a refactor of the automation software earlier in the year. This modification resulted in the target zone parameter being ignored and the shut down operation taking effect on VPC controllers in all cloud zones. The test environment caught this failure mode, but the error was misinterpreted as an expected failure in the test environment. As a result, the change made it to production.\nShutdowns are a routine operational practice that we perform to maintain our systems without customer impact. The automation has a safeguard in place to limit the scope of maintenance operations. This safeguard was inadvertently disabled during a migration to a new version of the automation framework, resulting in the shutdown operation taking effect on VPC controllers in all cloud zones.\nA separate instance of the VPC Controller is launched into every Google Cloud zone. The jobs running in a given zone are responsible for programming the hosts in that zone (such as GCE VM hosts) so that the Endpoints running on those machines are able to reach other Endpoints in their VPC networks, reach on-prem destinations via VPN / Interconnect, and reach the Internet.\nWithin each zone, the VPC Control Plane is sharded into different components, each of which is responsible for programming a subset of traffic paths. The intent behind this architecture is to isolate outages affecting control plane jobs, in order to limit the blast radius. Outages affecting control plane jobs within a given cluster are expected to only affect the local cluster, and, ideally, only a subset of traffic within the local cluster.\nThe VPC Network architecture follows a fail static design. If control plane jobs are not available, the data plane continues using the last programmed state until the control plane jobs provide an update. This design reduced the impact of this outage to network activity involving interaction with the control plane, detailed below.\nThe VPC controller shutdown affected a subset of Cloud VPC control plane jobs in all zones, impacting control plane operations such as creating new VMs, auto scaler operations, applying configuration changes to customer projects and accurately reflecting changes in VM health state. The data plane impact included packet loss during VM live migration and network congestion in some zones.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage through internal monitoring alerts at 15:41 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Maintenance operations were immediately paused to prevent a recurrence. In parallel, affected VPC Controllers were brought back to a serving state. Once the operations were completed, VPC controllers in most of the zones were operational by 17:30 US/Pacific.\nBy 18:09 US/Pacific, all VPC controllers were restored, and the backlog of applying changes to the dataplane cleared up by 18:40 US/Pacific, mitigating impact for most of the products. Some products took longer to mitigate as outlined below in the impact section.\nGoogle Cloud is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n1. Implement additional safety measures to validate maintenance operations have appropriately scoped zone information.\n2. Extend defense in depth by improving safety in underlying tools to reject maintenance operations without zones specified.\n3. Increase on-demand access control to limit the ability of maintenance operations to work across multiple zones in a single invocation.\n4. Ensure we have the required safety checks, appropriate testing and validation processes for maintenance operations including positive and negative test cases for the safety measures 1, 2 and 3 above to prevent regression.\nWe apologize for the impact of this issue and are taking steps to address the scope and duration of this incident as well as the root cause itself. We thank you for your business.\n**## Detailed Description of Impact**\n**AlloyDB for PostgreSQL:**\n- From 15:30 to 19:00 US/Pacific, new AlloyDB VM creation may have failed in the europe-west1, europe-west3, europe-north1, europe-north2, asia-east1 and asia-northeast1 regions. All of these regions encountered <0.5% creation failure while the asia-northeast1 region encountered around 1% instance creation failures.\n- There were about 10% auto failovers triggered in us-central1 and less than 1% auto-failovers triggered in other regions.\n**Apigee :**\n- From 15:22 to 18:10 US/Pacific, some Apigee customers may have experienced network latencies, timeouts, or 500 errors in their runtimes.\n**Apigee Edge Public Cloud:**\n- From 15:22 to 18:10 US/Pacific, some Apigee Edge customers using GCP infrastructure may have experienced network latencies, timeouts, or 500 errors in their runtimes.\n- Additionally, some customers encountered errors during proxy deployments, resulting in partial deployments.\n- The impact was mostly resolved automatically as the network recovered. However, some cases of partial proxy deployments required manual intervention and were recovered by 17 May 2024 01:00 US/Pacific.\n**Batch:**\n- From 15:50 to 18:00 US/Pacific, batch jobs experienced elevated “NO_VM_REPORT” failure rates globally.\n**Cloud Build:**\n- From 15:39 to 17:28 US/Pacific, build jobs were experiencing elevated scheduling latency or time outs globally.\n**Cloud Composer:**\n- From 15:40 to 17:30 US/Pacific, environment creation and update operations were failing across all regions. - 80% of environment creation operations failed. - Several environments that started image upgrade operation during the disruption were irrecoverably broken.\n- ~2.5% of Airflow tasks in running environments have failed globally due to a direct impact on connectivity of Composer components or outage impact on services that tasks have operated on.\n**Cloud Data Fusion:**\n- From 15:50 to 16:50 US/Pacific, new instance creation experienced failures globally.\n- Error rates for new instance creation remained elevated until 17:46 PDT.\n- Instance creation requests submitted during this period may have timed out (failed) or succeeded after a longer-than-usual delay.\n**Cloud Filestore:**\n- From 15:40 to 18:00 US/Pacific, Filestore instance operations such as Creation, and Deletion were degraded or failing in most regions and zones.\n- Some existing instances were unable to report metrics or start operations during this period, and due to the degraded VPC performance, customer VMs may not have been able to access existing instances.\n**Cloud Firewall:**\n- From 15:20 to 18:40 US/Pacific, all new firewall rules and firewall updates were not propagated. This affected firewall modifications for all VM instances in all GCE Zones.\n**Cloud IDS:**\n- From 15:45 to 18:40 US/Pacific, any calls to alter or create IDS Endpoints would have failed.\n- Packet Mirroring to existing Cloud IDS Endpoints continued working as intended.\n**Cloud Interconnect:**\n- From 15:45 to 18:09 US/Pacific, customers were unable to make any changes to their Cloud Interconnect resources because the control/management plane was down.\n- Most existing Interconnect attachments were unaffected, except that changes to learned BGP routes did not propagate during the outage.\n- A small number of attachments (1%) experienced dataplane packet loss triggered by maintenance operations (e.g. VM migration or attachment dataplane machine maintenance).\n**Cloud Load Balancing:**\n- From 16:00 to 18:20 US/Pacific, customers were unable to make changes to load balancer configurations that involved network programming as a dependency.\n- Some customers experienced data plane impact as well, manifested as 500 errors; this was either because certain workloads could not be autoscaled due to absence of network programming or programming for their network was not complete before the service disruption started.\n**Cloud NAT:**\n- From 15:45 to 18:20 US/Pacific, customers were unable to make any changes to their Cloud NAT resources because the control/management plane was down.\n- Cloud NAT Dynamic Port Allocation (DPA) experienced allocation failures.\n- Most existing NAT configurations were unaffected, although a small number (<1%) saw dataplane loss. In addition, a small number (<1%) of NAT configurations took up to two additional hours for control plane changes to take effect.\n**Cloud NGFW Enterprise.**\n- From 15:45 to 18:40 US/Pacific, any calls to alter or create firewall-endpoints, firewall-endpoint-associations, security-profiles, or security-profile-groups would have failed.\n- Packet Inspection through “Proceed to L7 Inspection” Firewall Rules continued to work as intended.\n**Cloud Router:**\n- From 15:45 to 18:20 US/Pacific, customers were unable to make any changes to their Cloud Router resources because the control/management plane was down.\n- Changes to Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routes or any new learned routes advertised by customers, or any changes to route health triggered by unhealthy Interconnects / VPN tunnels, would not have been applied to the dataplane. Most existing BGP sessions stayed up during this event.\n**Cloud Run:**\n- From 15:35 to 18:06 US/Pacific customers using Direct VPC Egress for Cloud Run were unable to deploy new services. Customers with existing services using Direct VPC Egress were unable to scale up, including from 0.\n- Customers using existing VPC Access Connectors may have experienced network slowdown due to VPC Access Connectors not being able to scale up. Customers were also unable to deploy new VPC Access Connectors.\n**Cloud Security Command Center:**\n- From 16:40 to 17:30 US/Pacific, 25% of scheduled Attack Path Simulations failed globally, affecting 7% of onboarded organizations.\n- The attack exposure scores of findings were not updated and new attack paths were not created during this time for affected customers.\n- Customers could still view older attack exposure scores and attack paths during this time.\n**Cloud Shell:**\n- From 15:50 to 16:50 US/Pacific, Cloud Shell sessions failed to start globally. ~15% of Cloud Shell sessions failed to startup.\n**Cloud VPN:**\n- From 15:45 to 18:40 US/Pacific, customers were unable to make any changes to their Cloud VPN resources because the control/management plane was down.\n- Most existing tunnels were not affected, except that changes to learned BGP routes did not propagate during the outage.\n- Routine VPN maintenance operations which occurred during this time window broke the dataplane for a small number (1%) of customer tunnels, which should have recovered along with the control plane.\n**Cloud Workstations:**\n- From 15:50 to 16:50 US/Pacific, Workstation startup failed primarily across US regions. Around 25% of Workstations failed to startup.\n**Colab Enterprise:**\n- From 15:50 to 16:50 US/Pacific, Colab Enterprise NotebookRuntime operations: AssignNotebookRuntime, StartNotebookRuntime, UpgradeNotebookRuntime failed globally.\n**Firebase Test Lab:**\n- Between 15:50 and 17:50 PDT, new Cloud VM creations failed globally.\n- Around 17% of the total VM creation requests globally at the time encountered issues.\n100% of customer executions failed on x86 emulators, impacting external customer CI tests, causing a complete pause of executions on those devices.\n**Google App Engine Flexible:**\n- From 15:35 to 18:06 US/Pacific customers were unable to create App Engine Flex deployments and App Engine Flex deployments were unable to scale up.\n**Google Cloud Dataflow:**\n- From 15:44 to 18:52 US/Pacific, Batch and streaming jobs became unhealthy in all regions: - New Dataflow jobs were not initialized successfully. - Already running Dataflow batch jobs experienced prolonged execution time - Already running Streaming jobs experienced elevated watermarks\n**Google Cloud Dataproc:**\n- From 15:34 to 18:16 US/Pacific, cluster creations failed globally.\n- Some cluster deletion workflows may have failed causing the corresponding VMs to not be entirely deleted. Our engineers have identified such VMs and performed a clean up after the service disruption was mitigated.\n**Google Cloud Deploy:**\n- From 15:39 to 17:28 US/Pacific, Cloud Deploy customers were experiencing significant latency or time outs for renders and deploys globally.\n**Google Cloud Functions:**\n- From 15:35 to 18:06 US/Pacific customers using Cloud Functions were unable to deploy globally.\n- Customers using existing VPC Access Connectors may have experienced network slowdown due to VPC Access Connectors not being able to scale up. Customers were also unable to deploy new VPC Access Connectors.\n**Google Cloud SQL:**\n- From 15:47 to 16:30 US/Pacific, all create, clone, restore operations were failing along with some patch & update operations. Some instances were impacted due to operational failures.\n- From 16:30 to 19:00 US/Pacific, recovery was started with 90% of the impacted instances restored or - recovered by 19:00. Failure rates were still elevated at about 10%.\n- All remaining instances were restored by 22:30 US/Pacific.\n**Google Compute Engine:**\n- From 15:45 to 16:45 US/Pacific, most of the networking requests experienced elevated failure rates globally.\n- From 16:00 to 17:15 US/Pacific, instance deletion and instance update operations experienced elevated failure rates globally.\n- From 15:45 to 18:15 US/Pacific, for instance group creation and deletion operations experienced elevated failure rates globally.\n**Google Kubernetes Engine:**\n- From 15:45 to 17:30 US/Pacific, GKE operations that created or updated a VM failed. These operations are cluster creation and deletion, node pool creation and deletion, node upgrade, scaling up existing nodepool, network configuration changes.\n**Infrastructure Manager:**\n- From 15:40 to 17:15 US/Pacific, deployment create/update/delete/unlock and preview create/delete operations degraded globally with increased latency and failures.\nCustomers could still view and export deployments, previews, revisions and resources.\n**Looker:**\n- From 15:50 to 17:30 US/Pacific, <0.2% of looker instances went down due to Cloud SQL DB connection failure.\n**Memorystore for Memcached:**\n- From 15:45 to 17:15 US/Pacific, Create, Update and Delete Memcache instance operations were failing across all regions.\n- Around 0.8% of existing nodes restarted with a downtime of approximately 50 minutes possibly because these VMs underwent live migration.\n**Memorystore for Redis:**\n- From 15:40 to 18:40 US/Pacific, newly started Redis instance VM nodes were unreachable for networking. These instances could have been newly created by the customer, created indirectly through a mutating change such as resource scaling or addition of a new replica, or created automatically due to routine system operations. Impacts would have manifested as Basic (unreplicated) instances being unusable, and on Standard instances it could have appeared as reduced reader capacity or outright instance unavailability. Some Redis instances experienced some long tail issues and eventually recovered at 20:05 US/Pacific.\n- In addition, mutating operations such as CreateInstance failed during this window.\n**Vertex AI Workbench:**\n- From 15:40 to 17:30 US/Pacific, customers could not provision new instances. Existing instances were not affected.\n**Virtual Private Cloud:**\n- From 15:20 to 18:40 US/Pacific, all new endpoints (e.g., VMs, VPN gateways) and services (load balancers) received no network programming and observed packet loss to a majority of destinations.\n- 0.07% of VMs that were migrated during the outage also experienced connectivity loss for the duration of the service disruption.\n- Long-running VMs were also affected due to data plane overload in a few locations. Peak loss was 3% in us-east1-c and average loss was 0.05% across all Cloud zones.\n- Access to Google Services was degraded in a few GCE zones; a fraction (up to 25% in us-east4-c) of TCP connections were blackholed. Applications that retry with a different TCP source port would have experienced limited outages even in these Cloud zones.\n--------------------",

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn 16 May 2024, the Google Infrastructure team was executing a routine maintenance action to shut down an unused Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) controller in a single Google Cloud zone. Unfortunately, a bug in the automation caused the component to be shut down in all zones where it was still in use. This resulted in networking connectivity issues and/or service disruptions for multiple Google Cloud products. The majority of the impact lasted 2 hours and 48 minutes.\nSome products took longer to fully recover based on the failures they experienced as outlined below in the impact section. To our Google Cloud customers, whose services were impacted, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe root cause was a bug in maintenance automation intended to shut down an unused VPC Controller in a single zone. A parameter specifying the zone for maintenance operations was modified during a refactor of the automation software earlier in the year. This modification resulted in the target zone parameter being ignored and the shut down operation taking effect on VPC controllers in all cloud zones. The test environment caught this failure mode, but the error was misinterpreted as an expected failure in the test environment. As a result, the change made it to production.\nShutdowns are a routine operational practice that we perform to maintain our systems without customer impact. The automation has a safeguard in place to limit the scope of maintenance operations. This safeguard was inadvertently disabled during a migration to a new version of the automation framework, resulting in the shutdown operation taking effect on VPC controllers in all cloud zones.\nA separate instance of the VPC Controller is launched into every Google Cloud zone. The jobs running in a given zone are responsible for programming the hosts in that zone (such as GCE VM hosts) so that the Endpoints running on those machines are able to reach other Endpoints in their VPC networks, reach on-prem destinations via VPN / Interconnect, and reach the Internet.\nWithin each zone, the VPC Control Plane is sharded into different components, each of which is responsible for programming a subset of traffic paths. The intent behind this architecture is to isolate outages affecting control plane jobs, in order to limit the blast radius. Outages affecting control plane jobs within a given cluster are expected to only affect the local cluster, and, ideally, only a subset of traffic within the local cluster.\nThe VPC Network architecture follows a fail static design. If control plane jobs are not available, the data plane continues using the last programmed state until the control plane jobs provide an update. This design reduced the impact of this outage to network activity involving interaction with the control plane, detailed below.\nThe VPC controller shutdown affected a subset of Cloud VPC control plane jobs in all zones, impacting control plane operations such as creating new VMs, auto scaler operations, applying configuration changes to customer projects and accurately reflecting changes in VM health state. The data plane impact included packet loss during VM live migration and network congestion in some zones.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage through internal monitoring alerts at 15:41 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Maintenance operations were immediately paused to prevent a recurrence. In parallel, affected VPC Controllers were brought back to a serving state. Once the operations were completed, VPC controllers in most of the zones were operational by 17:30 US/Pacific.\nBy 18:09 US/Pacific, all VPC controllers were restored, and the backlog of applying changes to the dataplane cleared up by 18:40 US/Pacific, mitigating impact for most of the products. Some products took longer to mitigate as outlined below in the impact section.\nGoogle Cloud is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n1. Implement additional safety measures to validate maintenance operations have appropriately scoped zone information.\n2. Extend defense in depth by improving safety in underlying tools to reject maintenance operations without zones specified.\n3. Increase on-demand access control to limit the ability of maintenance operations to work across multiple zones in a single invocation.\n4. Ensure we have the required safety checks, appropriate testing and validation processes for maintenance operations including positive and negative test cases for the safety measures 1, 2 and 3 above to prevent regression.\nWe apologize for the impact of this issue and are taking steps to address the scope and duration of this incident as well as the root cause itself. We thank you for your business.\n**## Detailed Description of Impact**\n**AlloyDB for PostgreSQL:**\n- From 15:30 to 19:00 US/Pacific, new AlloyDB VM creation may have failed in the europe-west1, europe-west3, europe-north1, europe-north2, asia-east1 and asia-northeast1 regions. All of these regions encountered <0.5% creation failure while the asia-northeast1 region encountered around 1% instance creation failures.\n- There were about 10% auto failovers triggered in us-central1 and less than 1% auto-failovers triggered in other regions.\n**Apigee :**\n- From 15:22 to 18:10 US/Pacific, some Apigee customers may have experienced network latencies, timeouts, or 500 errors in their runtimes.\n**Apigee Edge Public Cloud:**\n- From 15:22 to 18:10 US/Pacific, some Apigee Edge customers using GCP infrastructure may have experienced network latencies, timeouts, or 500 errors in their runtimes.\n- Additionally, some customers encountered errors during proxy deployments, resulting in partial deployments.\n- The impact was mostly resolved automatically as the network recovered. However, some cases of partial proxy deployments required manual intervention and were recovered by 17 May 2024 01:00 US/Pacific.\n**Batch:**\n- From 15:50 to 18:00 US/Pacific, batch jobs experienced elevated “NO_VM_REPORT” failure rates globally.\n**Cloud Build:**\n- From 15:39 to 17:28 US/Pacific, build jobs were experiencing elevated scheduling latency or time outs globally.\n**Cloud Composer:**\n- From 15:40 to 17:30 US/Pacific, environment creation and update operations were failing across all regions. - 80% of environment creation operations failed. - Several environments that started image upgrade operation during the disruption were irrecoverably broken.\n- ~2.5% of Airflow tasks in running environments have failed globally due to a direct impact on connectivity of Composer components or outage impact on services that tasks have operated on.\n**Cloud Data Fusion:**\n- From 15:50 to 16:50 US/Pacific, new instance creation experienced failures globally.\n- Error rates for new instance creation remained elevated until 17:46 PDT.\n- Instance creation requests submitted during this period may have timed out (failed) or succeeded after a longer-than-usual delay.\n**Cloud Filestore:**\n- From 15:40 to 18:00 US/Pacific, Filestore instance operations such as Creation, and Deletion were degraded or failing in most regions and zones.\n- Some existing instances were unable to report metrics or start operations during this period, and due to the degraded VPC performance, customer VMs may not have been able to access existing instances.\n**Cloud Firewall:**\n- From 15:20 to 18:40 US/Pacific, all new firewall rules and firewall updates were not propagated. This affected firewall modifications for all VM instances in all GCE Zones.\n**Cloud IDS:**\n- From 15:45 to 18:40 US/Pacific, any calls to alter or create IDS Endpoints would have failed.\n- Packet Mirroring to existing Cloud IDS Endpoints continued working as intended.\n**Cloud Interconnect:**\n- From 15:45 to 18:09 US/Pacific, customers were unable to make any changes to their Cloud Interconnect resources because the control/management plane was down.\n- Most existing Interconnect attachments were unaffected, except that changes to learned BGP routes did not propagate during the outage.\n- A small number of attachments (1%) experienced dataplane packet loss triggered by maintenance operations (e.g. VM migration or attachment dataplane machine maintenance).\n**Cloud Load Balancing:**\n- From 16:00 to 18:20 US/Pacific, customers were unable to make changes to load balancer configurations that involved network programming as a dependency.\n- Some customers experienced data plane impact as well, manifested as 500 errors; this was either because certain workloads could not be autoscaled due to absence of network programming or programming for their network was not complete before the service disruption started.\n**Cloud NAT:**\n- From 15:45 to 18:20 US/Pacific, customers were unable to make any changes to their Cloud NAT resources because the control/management plane was down.\n- Cloud NAT Dynamic Port Allocation (DPA) experienced allocation failures.\n- Most existing NAT configurations were unaffected, although a small number (<1%) saw dataplane loss. In addition, a small number (<1%) of NAT configurations took up to two additional hours for control plane changes to take effect.\n**Cloud NGFW Enterprise.**\n- From 15:45 to 18:40 US/Pacific, any calls to alter or create firewall-endpoints, firewall-endpoint-associations, security-profiles, or security-profile-groups would have failed.\n- Packet Inspection through “Proceed to L7 Inspection” Firewall Rules continued to work as intended.\n**Cloud Router:**\n- From 15:45 to 18:20 US/Pacific, customers were unable to make any changes to their Cloud Router resources because the control/management plane was down.\n- Changes to Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routes or any new learned routes advertised by customers, or any changes to route health triggered by unhealthy Interconnects / VPN tunnels, would not have been applied to the dataplane. Most existing BGP sessions stayed up during this event.\n**Cloud Run:**\n- From 15:35 to 18:06 US/Pacific customers using Direct VPC Egress for Cloud Run were unable to deploy new services. Customers with existing services using Direct VPC Egress were unable to scale up, including from 0.\n- Customers using existing VPC Access Connectors may have experienced network slowdown due to VPC Access Connectors not being able to scale up. Customers were also unable to deploy new VPC Access Connectors.\n**Cloud Security Command Center:**\n- From 16:40 to 17:30 US/Pacific, 25% of scheduled Attack Path Simulations failed globally, affecting 7% of onboarded organizations.\n- The attack exposure scores of findings were not updated and new attack paths were not created during this time for affected customers.\n- Customers could still view older attack exposure scores and attack paths during this time.\n**Cloud Shell:**\n- From 15:50 to 16:50 US/Pacific, Cloud Shell sessions failed to start globally. ~15% of Cloud Shell sessions failed to startup.\n**Cloud VPN:**\n- From 15:45 to 18:40 US/Pacific, customers were unable to make any changes to their Cloud VPN resources because the control/management plane was down.\n- Most existing tunnels were not affected, except that changes to learned BGP routes did not propagate during the outage.\n- Routine VPN maintenance operations which occurred during this time window broke the dataplane for a small number (1%) of customer tunnels, which should have recovered along with the control plane.\n**Cloud Workstations:**\n- From 15:50 to 16:50 US/Pacific, Workstation startup failed primarily across US regions. Around 25% of Workstations failed to startup.\n**Colab Enterprise:**\n- From 15:50 to 16:50 US/Pacific, Colab Enterprise NotebookRuntime operations: AssignNotebookRuntime, StartNotebookRuntime, UpgradeNotebookRuntime failed globally.\n**Firebase Test Lab:**\n- Between 15:50 and 17:50 PDT, new Cloud VM creations failed globally.\n- Around 17% of the total VM creation requests globally at the time encountered issues.\n100% of customer executions failed on x86 emulators, impacting external customer CI tests, causing a complete pause of executions on those devices.\n**Google App Engine Flexible:**\n- From 15:35 to 18:06 US/Pacific customers were unable to create App Engine Flex deployments and App Engine Flex deployments were unable to scale up.\n**Google Cloud Dataflow:**\n- From 15:44 to 18:52 US/Pacific, Batch and streaming jobs became unhealthy in all regions: - New Dataflow jobs were not initialized successfully. - Already running Dataflow batch jobs experienced prolonged execution time - Already running Streaming jobs experienced elevated watermarks\n**Google Cloud Dataproc:**\n- From 15:34 to 18:16 US/Pacific, cluster creations failed globally.\n- Some cluster deletion workflows may have failed causing the corresponding VMs to not be entirely deleted. Our engineers have identified such VMs and performed a clean up after the service disruption was mitigated.\n**Google Cloud Deploy:**\n- From 15:39 to 17:28 US/Pacific, Cloud Deploy customers were experiencing significant latency or time outs for renders and deploys globally.\n**Google Cloud Functions:**\n- From 15:35 to 18:06 US/Pacific customers using Cloud Functions were unable to deploy globally.\n- Customers using existing VPC Access Connectors may have experienced network slowdown due to VPC Access Connectors not being able to scale up. Customers were also unable to deploy new VPC Access Connectors.\n**Google Cloud SQL:**\n- From 15:47 to 16:30 US/Pacific, all create, clone, restore operations were failing along with some patch & update operations. Some instances were impacted due to operational failures.\n- From 16:30 to 19:00 US/Pacific, recovery was started with 90% of the impacted instances restored or - recovered by 19:00. Failure rates were still elevated at about 10%.\n- All remaining instances were restored by 22:30 US/Pacific.\n**Google Compute Engine:**\n- From 15:45 to 16:45 US/Pacific, most of the networking requests experienced elevated failure rates globally.\n- From 16:00 to 17:15 US/Pacific, instance deletion and instance update operations experienced elevated failure rates globally.\n- From 15:45 to 18:15 US/Pacific, for instance group creation and deletion operations experienced elevated failure rates globally.\n**Google Kubernetes Engine:**\n- From 15:45 to 17:30 US/Pacific, GKE operations that created or updated a VM failed. These operations are cluster creation and deletion, node pool creation and deletion, node upgrade, scaling up existing nodepool, network configuration changes.\n**Infrastructure Manager:**\n- From 15:40 to 17:15 US/Pacific, deployment create/update/delete/unlock and preview create/delete operations degraded globally with increased latency and failures.\nCustomers could still view and export deployments, previews, revisions and resources.\n**Looker:**\n- From 15:50 to 17:30 US/Pacific, <0.2% of looker instances went down due to Cloud SQL DB connection failure.\n**Memorystore for Memcached:**\n- From 15:45 to 17:15 US/Pacific, Create, Update and Delete Memcache instance operations were failing across all regions.\n- Around 0.8% of existing nodes restarted with a downtime of approximately 50 minutes possibly because these VMs underwent live migration.\n**Memorystore for Redis:**\n- From 15:40 to 18:40 US/Pacific, newly started Redis instance VM nodes were unreachable for networking. These instances could have been newly created by the customer, created indirectly through a mutating change such as resource scaling or addition of a new replica, or created automatically due to routine system operations. Impacts would have manifested as Basic (unreplicated) instances being unusable, and on Standard instances it could have appeared as reduced reader capacity or outright instance unavailability. Some Redis instances experienced some long tail issues and eventually recovered at 20:05 US/Pacific.\n- In addition, mutating operations such as CreateInstance failed during this window.\n**Vertex AI Workbench:**\n- From 15:40 to 17:30 US/Pacific, customers could not provision new instances. Existing instances were not affected.\n**Virtual Private Cloud:**\n- From 15:20 to 18:40 US/Pacific, all new endpoints (e.g., VMs, VPN gateways) and services (load balancers) received no network programming and observed packet loss to a majority of destinations.\n- 0.07% of VMs that were migrated during the outage also experienced connectivity loss for the duration of the service disruption.\n- Long-running VMs were also affected due to data plane overload in a few locations. Peak loss was 3% in us-east1-c and average loss was 0.05% across all Cloud zones.\n- Access to Google Services was degraded in a few GCE zones; a fraction (up to 25% in us-east4-c) of TCP connections were blackholed. Applications that retry with a different TCP source port would have experienced limited outages even in these Cloud zones.\n--------------------",

        "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn Wednesday, 8 May 2024, multiple Google Cloud services experienced a partial service outage in australia-southeast1-a for varying durations of up to 2 hours and 55 minutes. The full list of impacted products and services is detailed below.\nTo our Google Cloud customers whose businesses were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you.\n## Root Cause\nOn 8 May, at 18:44 US/Pacific, a public utility power issue resulted in an undervoltage condition followed by power loss that affected a portion of Google’s third-party data center in Sydney. As a result of this issue, the operating current exceeded the trip settings of the automatic transfer switch (ATS) units.\nATS units have trip settings to protect the load from electrical faults. Additionally, ATS units are configured in pairs to provide a redundant power path to the critical load.\nIn this case, both ATS units feeding the affected rows exceeded their trip settings due to overcurrent. Further investigation into the ATS units determined that they were configured with trip settings that were not in accordance with the site design.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage via internal monitoring on Wednesday, 8 May at 18:55 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. On-site data center operations were engaged at 19:00 US/Pacific, and the scope of the power loss was confirmed at 19:22 US/Pacific.\nOn-site engineers restored power to the affected rows at 19:00 US/Pacific by manually closing breakers for both of the ATS units.\nOn Wednesday, 8 May at19:42 US/Pacific, network connectivity for the affected racks began recovering. All services had recovered by 21:55 US/Pacific with the exception of a very small percentage of Persistent Disk devices which required manual intervention.\nOn Thursday, 9 May at 07:47 US/Pacific, the public utility power issue was resolved.\nAll power had been switched back to utility feeds on Thursday, 9 May at 09:26 US/Pacific.\nGoogle is committed preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n* A case has been opened with the utility provider to determine the cause of the power event that led to the undervoltage condition.\n* Audit and update all ATS device settings if needed based on current site load.\n* Complete a full audit of all operational procedures for the Sydney third-party data center location.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Wednesday 8 May, from 18:45 to 21:40 US/Pacific, multiple Google Cloud services experienced a partial service outage in the australia-southeast1-a zone.\n**Persistent Disk:**\n* From 18:45 to 21:45 US/Pacific, approximately 0.4% of Persistent Disk devices in australia-southeast1-a experienced failures for disk operations, including snapshots, clones, and attachments.\n* Approximately 0.05% of PD devices experienced extended impact and required manual intervention.\n**Google Cloud Dataflow:**\n* From 18:45 to 21:55 US/Pacific, customers experienced increased latency for affected streaming jobs.\n* From 19:45 to 20:45 US/Pacific, some batch jobs took longer than normal to execute.\n* From 18:49 to 19:15 US/Pacific, a small number of new job submissions failed.\n**Google Cloud Pub/Sub:**\n* For a total of 13 minutes between 18:46 to 19:19 US/Pacific, affected customers experienced intermittent request error rates up to 1% and elevated message delivery latency.\n**Google BigQuery:**\n* From 18:45 to 21:50 US/Pacific, 0.8% of job failures for Job API and 5 minutes of failures for Metadata API.\n* From 19:00 to 19:20: 17% of projects experienced slower than normal performance.\n* From 21:25 to 22:25: over 10% of projects experienced slower than normal performance.\n**Google Compute Engine:**\n* From 18:45 to 19:30 US/Pacific, 11.8% of VMs in australia-southeast1-a were paused and restarted, and another 4.0% experienced pauses without restarting.\n**Cloud Filestore:**\n* From 18:45 to 21:43 US/Pacific, affected customers were unable to access their NFS filestore in the australia-southeast1-a zone.\n**Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):**\n* From 18:45 to 21:31 US/Pacific, affected customers experienced delays while creating new VMs and packet loss / unreachability for existing VMs. The VMs in australia-southeast1-a which went down could have faced delayed programming upon recreation. Roughly half of the traffic to australia-southeast1-a VMs was dropped.\n**Cloud SQL:**\n* From 18:45 to 21:45 US/Pacific, affected customers were unable to access their Cloud SQL instances in australia-southeast1-a. High Availability instances successfully failed over to other zones and recovered in 1-4 minutes. The majority of affected zonal instances were inaccessible for 20-30 minutes, with a few experiencing extended recovery times of up to 3 hours.\n**Cloud Logging:**\n* From 18:45 to 19:05 US/Pacific, affected customers may have experienced a small increase in error rates for inflight requests in this zone.\n* Cloud Logging is a regional service so the vast majority of the requests in the australia-southeast1 region were not affected.\n**Cloud Bigtable:**\n* From 18:45 to 19:10 US/Pacific, affected customers would have experienced high error rates in australia-southeast1-a.\n**Cloud Apigee:**\n* From 18:45 to 19:15 US/Pacific, there were multiple periods of impact ranging from 5 to 30 minutes, with error rates between 5% and 38% respectively, due to nodes restarting.\n* During the impact periods, customers may have experienced a “GKE cluster is currently undergoing repair\" error.\n**Memorystore for Redis**\n* From 18:46 to 21:31 US/Pacific, a subset of basic tier instances in australia-southeast1-a zone would have been unavailable.\n* Affected standard tier instances may have experienced brief unavailability as they failed over to replicas.\n**Dialogflow**\n* From 18:45 to 19:15 US/Pacific, affected customers would have experienced up to a 3% error rate in australia-southeast1.\n**Google Kubernetes Engine**\n* From 18:45 to approximately 19:45 US/Pacific, 14% of GKE clusters in australia-southeast1 were unavailable.",

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn Wednesday, 8 May 2024, multiple Google Cloud services experienced a partial service outage in australia-southeast1-a for varying durations of up to 2 hours and 55 minutes. The full list of impacted products and services is detailed below.\nTo our Google Cloud customers whose businesses were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you.\n## Root Cause\nOn 8 May, at 18:44 US/Pacific, a public utility power issue resulted in an undervoltage condition followed by power loss that affected a portion of Google’s third-party data center in Sydney. As a result of this issue, the operating current exceeded the trip settings of the automatic transfer switch (ATS) units.\nATS units have trip settings to protect the load from electrical faults. Additionally, ATS units are configured in pairs to provide a redundant power path to the critical load.\nIn this case, both ATS units feeding the affected rows exceeded their trip settings due to overcurrent. Further investigation into the ATS units determined that they were configured with trip settings that were not in accordance with the site design.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage via internal monitoring on Wednesday, 8 May at 18:55 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. On-site data center operations were engaged at 19:00 US/Pacific, and the scope of the power loss was confirmed at 19:22 US/Pacific.\nOn-site engineers restored power to the affected rows at 19:00 US/Pacific by manually closing breakers for both of the ATS units.\nOn Wednesday, 8 May at19:42 US/Pacific, network connectivity for the affected racks began recovering. All services had recovered by 21:55 US/Pacific with the exception of a very small percentage of Persistent Disk devices which required manual intervention.\nOn Thursday, 9 May at 07:47 US/Pacific, the public utility power issue was resolved.\nAll power had been switched back to utility feeds on Thursday, 9 May at 09:26 US/Pacific.\nGoogle is committed preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n* A case has been opened with the utility provider to determine the cause of the power event that led to the undervoltage condition.\n* Audit and update all ATS device settings if needed based on current site load.\n* Complete a full audit of all operational procedures for the Sydney third-party data center location.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Wednesday 8 May, from 18:45 to 21:40 US/Pacific, multiple Google Cloud services experienced a partial service outage in the australia-southeast1-a zone.\n**Persistent Disk:**\n* From 18:45 to 21:45 US/Pacific, approximately 0.4% of Persistent Disk devices in australia-southeast1-a experienced failures for disk operations, including snapshots, clones, and attachments.\n* Approximately 0.05% of PD devices experienced extended impact and required manual intervention.\n**Google Cloud Dataflow:**\n* From 18:45 to 21:55 US/Pacific, customers experienced increased latency for affected streaming jobs.\n* From 19:45 to 20:45 US/Pacific, some batch jobs took longer than normal to execute.\n* From 18:49 to 19:15 US/Pacific, a small number of new job submissions failed.\n**Google Cloud Pub/Sub:**\n* For a total of 13 minutes between 18:46 to 19:19 US/Pacific, affected customers experienced intermittent request error rates up to 1% and elevated message delivery latency.\n**Google BigQuery:**\n* From 18:45 to 21:50 US/Pacific, 0.8% of job failures for Job API and 5 minutes of failures for Metadata API.\n* From 19:00 to 19:20: 17% of projects experienced slower than normal performance.\n* From 21:25 to 22:25: over 10% of projects experienced slower than normal performance.\n**Google Compute Engine:**\n* From 18:45 to 19:30 US/Pacific, 11.8% of VMs in australia-southeast1-a were paused and restarted, and another 4.0% experienced pauses without restarting.\n**Cloud Filestore:**\n* From 18:45 to 21:43 US/Pacific, affected customers were unable to access their NFS filestore in the australia-southeast1-a zone.\n**Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):**\n* From 18:45 to 21:31 US/Pacific, affected customers experienced delays while creating new VMs and packet loss / unreachability for existing VMs. The VMs in australia-southeast1-a which went down could have faced delayed programming upon recreation. Roughly half of the traffic to australia-southeast1-a VMs was dropped.\n**Cloud SQL:**\n* From 18:45 to 21:45 US/Pacific, affected customers were unable to access their Cloud SQL instances in australia-southeast1-a. High Availability instances successfully failed over to other zones and recovered in 1-4 minutes. The majority of affected zonal instances were inaccessible for 20-30 minutes, with a few experiencing extended recovery times of up to 3 hours.\n**Cloud Logging:**\n* From 18:45 to 19:05 US/Pacific, affected customers may have experienced a small increase in error rates for inflight requests in this zone.\n* Cloud Logging is a regional service so the vast majority of the requests in the australia-southeast1 region were not affected.\n**Cloud Bigtable:**\n* From 18:45 to 19:10 US/Pacific, affected customers would have experienced high error rates in australia-southeast1-a.\n**Cloud Apigee:**\n* From 18:45 to 19:15 US/Pacific, there were multiple periods of impact ranging from 5 to 30 minutes, with error rates between 5% and 38% respectively, due to nodes restarting.\n* During the impact periods, customers may have experienced a “GKE cluster is currently undergoing repair\" error.\n**Memorystore for Redis**\n* From 18:46 to 21:31 US/Pacific, a subset of basic tier instances in australia-southeast1-a zone would have been unavailable.\n* Affected standard tier instances may have experienced brief unavailability as they failed over to replicas.\n**Dialogflow**\n* From 18:45 to 19:15 US/Pacific, affected customers would have experienced up to a 3% error rate in australia-southeast1.\n**Google Kubernetes Engine**\n* From 18:45 to approximately 19:45 US/Pacific, 14% of GKE clusters in australia-southeast1 were unavailable.",

This effect accumulated and further slowed down the system's processing and resulted in the jobs to remain in Queued status instead of progressing to Scheduled status.\nGoogle engineers were alerted by our internal monitoring and immediately started an investigation. Once the nature of impact was clear, our engineering team mitigated the impact by disabling new job scheduling, and cleared the stuck jobs by restarting them.\n**Customer Impact:**\nCustomers from the affected region trying to use Batch experienced delays while changing the status of their batch jobs from Queued to Scheduled.

This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe root cause was due to an issue introduced by a recent change to the latest stable Container Operating System (COS) image used by Cloud Composer in one of its workloads.\nThe new version of the COS image (M113) moved from iptables-legacy to iptables-nft package as the default, which impacted Konlet (system executing containers)’s handling of iptables to break.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage via our monitoring tools on 16 April at 09:17 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Once the nature and scope of the issue became clear, Google engineers reverted the recently introduced rollout.\nGoogle is committed preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n- Improve our monitoring systems to ensure that in the future during similar scenarios we would be notified quicker what could help with resolving an issue earlier.\n- Cloud Composer team will modify the approach of ingesting new container base images to regionalize it and be independent of the ongoing rollouts of the base image versions.\n- The process of intake and testing of container base images will be extended to make the testing more extensive.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nBetween 16 April 2024 from 02:20 to 17 April, 03:40 US/Pacific impacted customers might have experienced issues with:\n- Creating new Composer Environments with Private IP configuration failed. In total we observed < 200 customer projects where creations failed due to the issue.\n- Upgrades and resize operations for existing Composer Environments in the Private IP configuration failed. In total we observed < 20 environments with failed upgrades due to the issue.\n- Environments in Private IP configuration might have encountered issues with scaling for increased database-intensive workloads.\n- Existing Composer 2 Environments, if not modified, functioned correctly.\n- Customers who triggered an upgrade during an outage were facing an issue with the Composer environment which was unhealthy, including workloads with failed upgrades which could have caused ongoing performance issues.\n- Once the issue was mitigated, the impacted environments returned to the healthy state.\nDuring the outage customers were asked to refrain from performing upgrade operations until mitigation has been confirmed.\n**Additional Information for Customers:**\n- Fewer than 20 of the customer environments encountered upgrade failures and all of the customer environments with “Private IP” configuration that experienced upgrade failures during the incident will now upgrade successfully.\nIf you are one of the customers that experienced upgrade failure during the incident and still continue to have issues with further upgrades, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support for assistance with recovery.",

This was due to an inadvertent issue introduced by a recent change to the latest stable Container Operating System (COS) image used by Cloud Composer in one of its workloads.\nExisting Private IP environments continued to operate normally if they were not upgraded or resized.\nGoogle engineers executed a rollback of the change to mitigate the issue on 17 April 2024 at 03:40 US/Pacific.\nGoogle will complete a full Incident Report in the following days that will provide a detailed root cause.\n**Customer Impact:**\n- Impacted users experienced issues with creating new Composer Environments, upgrades, and resize operations for existing Composer Environments in Private IP configuration.\n- Composer environments with failed upgrades were unhealthy and workloads could fail or experience performance issues\n- Environments might have encountered issues with scaling for increase database-intensive workloads\n**Additional details:**\n- Less than 0.25% of the customer environments encountered upgrade failures and some of the customer environments with “Private IP” configuration that experienced upgrade failures during the incident will now upgrade successfully.\n- A few environments may still experience failures on further upgrades. These environments are still functioning normally and will continue serving workloads without any issues. Our engineers are working internally to identify these environments and take additional actions so that they can be further upgraded successfully. These actions are expected to be completed by early next week.\nIf you are one of the customers that experienced upgrade failure during the incident and still continue to have issues with further upgrades, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support for assistance with recovery. Alternatively, you can recreate these environments.\n--------",

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nBetween 16 and 17 April 2024, Cloud Composer users experienced an elevated failure rate when creating, resizing or upgrading to newer versions of Cloud Composer 2 Environments with “Private IP” configuration for a duration of 1 day, 1 hour and 20 minutes.\nExisting Private IP environments continued to operate normally if they were not upgraded or resized.\nTo our Cloud Composer customers whose businesses were impacted during this disruption: we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe root cause was due to an issue introduced by a recent change to the latest stable Container Operating System (COS) image used by Cloud Composer in one of its workloads.\nThe new version of the COS image (M113) moved from iptables-legacy to iptables-nft package as the default, which impacted Konlet (system executing containers)’s handling of iptables to break.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage via our monitoring tools on 16 April at 09:17 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Once the nature and scope of the issue became clear, Google engineers reverted the recently introduced rollout.\nGoogle is committed preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n- Improve our monitoring systems to ensure that in the future during similar scenarios we would be notified quicker what could help with resolving an issue earlier.\n- Cloud Composer team will modify the approach of ingesting new container base images to regionalize it and be independent of the ongoing rollouts of the base image versions.\n- The process of intake and testing of container base images will be extended to make the testing more extensive.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nBetween 16 April 2024 from 02:20 to 17 April, 03:40 US/Pacific impacted customers might have experienced issues with:\n- Creating new Composer Environments with Private IP configuration failed. In total we observed < 200 customer projects where creations failed due to the issue.\n- Upgrades and resize operations for existing Composer Environments in the Private IP configuration failed. In total we observed < 20 environments with failed upgrades due to the issue.\n- Environments in Private IP configuration might have encountered issues with scaling for increased database-intensive workloads.\n- Existing Composer 2 Environments, if not modified, functioned correctly.\n- Customers who triggered an upgrade during an outage were facing an issue with the Composer environment which was unhealthy, including workloads with failed upgrades which could have caused ongoing performance issues.\n- Once the issue was mitigated, the impacted environments returned to the healthy state.\nDuring the outage customers were asked to refrain from performing upgrade operations until mitigation has been confirmed.\n**Additional Information for Customers:**\n- Fewer than 20 of the customer environments encountered upgrade failures and all of the customer environments with “Private IP” configuration that experienced upgrade failures during the incident will now upgrade successfully.\nIf you are one of the customers that experienced upgrade failure during the incident and still continue to have issues with further upgrades, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support for assistance with recovery.",

From preliminary analysis, the root cause was related to a recent rollout that improperly configured an access transparency check for some of Chronicle Security’s back-end data processing pipelines.\nGoogle Engineers completed a roll back of the change that introduced the issue at 18:09, which allowed the affected data pipelines to run. All of the affected data pipelines had successfully completed by 30 March 2024 at 05:26, fully resolving impact.\n**Customer Impact:**\nCustomers experienced delays in data availability in all regions for multiple Chronicle system components and product features, including Entity Graph, BigQuery Export, UEBA Simple Analytics, and Log Export.",

From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was due to a recent configuration change for an internal critical dependency that serves as a backend gateway for the affected products.\n**Customer Impact:**\nImpacted customers encountered multiple periods of internal or unavailable errors for streaming API actions (StreamingAnalyzeContent, StreamingDetectIntent).\n* 20 March 2024 09:58 - 11:40 US/Pacific (1 hour, 42 minutes)\n* 20 March 2024 14:15 - 14:45 US/Pacific (30 minutes)\n**Additional details:**\nOn 20 March 2024, at 11:40 US/Pacific, Google engineers reversed the configuration change to the internal critical dependency, which temporarily alleviated the impact while a permanent solution was being developed.\nAt 14:15 US/Pacific, a previously scheduled rollout for the dependency service completed, unintentionally reverting the temporary mitigation that engineers had put in place. Engineers reapplied the temporary mitigation at 14:45 US/Pacific.\nOn 21 March 2024, at 16:31 US/Pacific, engineers effectively implemented a new version of the dependency service that includes the necessary mitigation measures, successfully preventing any further regressions.\nReference\n* [1] https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/region#avail",

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support .\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**First Impact Window Start:** 20 March 2024 09:58\n**First Impact Window end:** 20 March 2024 11:40\n**Duration:** 1 hour, 42 minutes\n**Second Impact Window Start:** 20 March 2024 14:15\n**Second Impact Window end:** 20 March 2024 14:45\n**Duration:** 30 minutes\nCumulative impact duration: 2 hours, 12 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\n* Dialogflow ES\n* Dialogflow CX\n* Cloud Speech-to-Text\n* Agent Assist\n**Regions/Zones:**\n* Global\n* Regions: us-east1, us-central1, us-west1, northamerica-northeast1 [1]\n**Description:**\nDialogflow ES, Dialogflow CX, Cloud Speech-to-Text, and Agent Assist experienced two periods of elevated errors for streaming data plane traffic for durations of 1 hours, 42 minutes and 30 minutes, respectively. From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was due to a recent configuration change for an internal critical dependency that serves as a backend gateway for the affected products.\n**Customer Impact:**\nImpacted customers encountered multiple periods of internal or unavailable errors for streaming API actions (StreamingAnalyzeContent, StreamingDetectIntent).\n* 20 March 2024 09:58 - 11:40 US/Pacific (1 hour, 42 minutes)\n* 20 March 2024 14:15 - 14:45 US/Pacific (30 minutes)\n**Additional details:**\nOn 20 March 2024, at 11:40 US/Pacific, Google engineers reversed the configuration change to the internal critical dependency, which temporarily alleviated the impact while a permanent solution was being developed.\nAt 14:15 US/Pacific, a previously scheduled rollout for the dependency service completed, unintentionally reverting the temporary mitigation that engineers had put in place. Engineers reapplied the temporary mitigation at 14:45 US/Pacific.\nOn 21 March 2024, at 16:31 US/Pacific, engineers effectively implemented a new version of the dependency service that includes the necessary mitigation measures, successfully preventing any further regressions.\nReference\n* [1] https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/region#avail",

Please note that Google worked with the appropriate partner to resolve the underlying issue. This is the final version of the report and no further information will be provided here. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 12 March 2024 08:00\n**Incident End:** 12 March 2024 14:55\n**Duration:** 6 hours, 55 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nGoogle Kubernetes Engine (GKE)\n**Regions/Zones:** [All GPU regions and zones](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gpus/gpu-regions-zones)\n**Description:**\nGoogle Kubernetes Engine experienced elevated errors due to failures in downloading some NVIDIA GPU drivers for use with Container-Optimized OS (COS) for a duration of 6 hours, 55 minutes. These failures in downloading the GPU drivers led to node unavailability in some cases and impacted customers using T4, L4, H100 80GB and A100 GPUs, [COS milestone](https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs/release-notes) 105 or above, and those who were attempting to install GPU driver versions R525 and above.\nFrom the preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was an access issue to the storage bucket required for driver downloads. This is owned by our partner that supplies these GPU drivers. To limit the impact, Google Cloud took swift actions while the issue was happening, by halting automatic node recreations (which attempt GPU driver downloads) until the issue was mitigated. Other GKE features continued to operate normally without disruption.\n**Customer Impact:**\n* GKE users encountered an error \"Failed to download GPU driver installer, status: 403 Forbidden\" on the GPU node when installing affected GPU drivers using COS. In some cases, the GPU driver download failures led to node unavailability.\n* GPU driver downloads for GPU models P4, P100, V100, K80 were unaffected.\n--------",

      "text": "# Mini Incident Report\nWe apologize for the inconvenience this service outage may have caused. We would like to provide some information about this incident below. Please note that Google worked with the appropriate partner to resolve the underlying issue. This is the final version of the report and no further information will be provided here. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 12 March 2024 08:00\n**Incident End:** 12 March 2024 14:55\n**Duration:** 6 hours, 55 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nGoogle Kubernetes Engine (GKE)\n**Regions/Zones:** [All GPU regions and zones](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gpus/gpu-regions-zones)\n**Description:**\nGoogle Kubernetes Engine experienced elevated errors due to failures in downloading some NVIDIA GPU drivers for use with Container-Optimized OS (COS) for a duration of 6 hours, 55 minutes. These failures in downloading the GPU drivers led to node unavailability in some cases and impacted customers using T4, L4, H100 80GB and A100 GPUs, [COS milestone](https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs/release-notes) 105 or above, and those who were attempting to install GPU driver versions R525 and above.\nFrom the preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was an access issue to the storage bucket required for driver downloads. This is owned by our partner that supplies these GPU drivers. To limit the impact, Google Cloud took swift actions while the issue was happening, by halting automatic node recreations (which attempt GPU driver downloads) until the issue was mitigated. Other GKE features continued to operate normally without disruption.\n**Customer Impact:**\n* GKE users encountered an error \"Failed to download GPU driver installer, status: 403 Forbidden\" on the GPU node when installing affected GPU drivers using COS. In some cases, the GPU driver download failures led to node unavailability.\n* GPU driver downloads for GPU models P4, P100, V100, K80 were unaffected.\n--------",

        "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn 14 February 2024 from 09:45 AM to 12:52 PM US/Pacific, Google Cloud customers in us-west1 experienced control plane unavailability because of elevated latencies and errors. In addition, a few services experienced data plane unavailability for the same reason. The full list of impacted products and services are detailed below.\nTo our Google Cloud customers whose businesses were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you.\n## Root Cause\nMost Google Cloud products and services use a regional metadata store to support their internal operations. The metadata store supports critical functions such as servicing customer requests and handling scale, load balancing, admin operations and for retrieving/storing metadata including server location information.\nThe regional metadata store continuously manages load by automatically adjusting compute capacity in response to changes in demand. When usage increases, additional resources are added and load is also balanced automatically. However, an unexpected spike in demand exceeded the system’s ability to quickly provision additional resources. As a result, multiple Google Cloud products and services in the region experienced elevated latencies and errors until the unexpected load was isolated.\n## Remediation and Prevention/Detection\nGoogle engineers were alerted to this problem by our internal monitoring system and throttled the spiking workloads on the underlying regional metadata store. This allowed Google Cloud products and services to read/write state at a normal rate allowing for healthy servicing of customer requests after the backlog of operations on the regional metadata store were processed.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n- Improve monitoring and alerting for an earlier detection of unexpected spikes in the regional metadata stores.\n- Enhance the ability of regional data stores to automatically throttle workloads more aggressively when experiencing unexpected spikes.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\n### Google Compute Engine\n* From 10:30 AM to 12:30 PM US/Pacific, a number of GCE APIs returned internal or timeout errors in the us-west1 region, across all zones. The overall error rate for most APIs remained around 1% with errors affecting around 33% of projects in the region.\n* From 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM US/Pacific, less than 0.004% VMs running in the region crashed, 80% of the crashed VMs recovered while 20% of the crashed VMs experienced delays in rescheduling.\n* From 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM US/Pacific, about 1% of read/write requests in the region for [guest attributes](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/metadata/overview#guest_attributes) failed or experienced latency exceeding 1 second.\n### Google Cloud Pub/Sub Lite\n* From 10:05 AM to 12:00 PM US/Pacific, customers may have experienced elevated end-to-end latency and publish request latency in us-west1. At peak impact, 65% of publish requests in the region failed with aborted, canceled, deadline exceeded, or unavailable errors, affecting up to 47% of projects publishing in the region. Resource administrative operations also displayed unavailability in the region.\n### App Engine Standard\n* From 09:45 AM to 11:42 AM US/Pacific, ~6% of customers in the region experienced deployment failures and latency on deployments for Google App Engine apps.\n### Cloud Functions\n* From 09:45 AM to 11:42 AM US/Pacific, ~6% of customers in the region experienced deployment failures and latency on deployments for Cloud Function apps.\n### Cloud Run\n* From 09:45 AM to 11:42 AM US/Pacific, ~2% of Customers in the region experienced deployment failures and latency on deployments for Cloud Run apps.\n### Dialogflow CX\n* From 9:45 AM to 11:45 AM US/Pacific, a percentage of Dialogflow requests returned internal or timeout errors in the us-west1 region. The error rate stayed below 5% before peaking at 100% around 11:00 US/Pacific.\n### Vertex AI products:\n* From about 10:15 AM to 11:35 AM US/Pacific, all Vertex AI services that heavily rely on metadata store operations including Online Prediction, Training, and Featurestore, ML Metadata and Notebooks experienced ~50% error rates (spiking to near 100% at times) in the region.\n### Google Cloud Pub/Sub\n* From 09:57 AM to 11:26 AM US/Pacific, Cloud Pub/Sub customers with traffic in us-west1 experienced publish errors and unavailability. The publish error rate peaked at ~99% for customers with publish traffic in us-west1. In addition, backlog stats metrics were unavailable for some customers who did not have publish or subscribe traffic in us-west1.\n### Cloud Memorystore\n* From 10:05 AM and 11:35 AM US/Pacific, customers creating, updating, deleting, importing, or exporting Redis Standalone or Cluster instances in us-west1 may have experienced failures. Around 17% of such requests failed with timeouts or internal errors.\n### Eventarc\n* From 10:30 AM and 11:30 AM US/Pacific Eventarc customers in us-west1 experienced event delivery delays for up to 50 minutes as we saw event publish errors in our dataplane that peaked at 100%. There are high error ratios and latencies for all control plane long running operations with peak error rate at 100% and peak latency of 55 minutes.\n### Dataproc Metastore\n* From 10:00 AM and 11:45 AM US/Pacific, all control plane operations were sporadically returning an internal or deadline exceeded error (differing ratios throughout the outage) in the region. The peak impact was from around 10:30 AM to 11:30 AM US/Pacific where only around 3.33% of operations were completed with OK.\n### Google Cloud Tasks\n* From 10:40 AM and 11:30 AM US/Pacific, Cloud Tasks’s main data operation (CreateTask) returned DEADLINE_EXCEEDED error for all requests in us-west1. This means customers in this region were not able to buffer Tasks and, subsequently, our system was not able to dispatch them.\n### Cloud Build\n* From 9:45 AM to 12:00 PM US/Pacific, using Cloud Build to create or retry builds may have failed in us-west1. ~15-20% of requests failed during the issue.\n### Cloud SQL\n* From 10:06 AM to 11:46 AM US/Pacific, Many operations requiring the regional metadata store in us-west1 timed out or failed, this affected Cloud SQL instance creations or any modifications to existing us-west1 instances. 30% of instance creations failed, 10% of export operations failed, and <10% of update operations failed in us-west1.\n### Speech-to-text\n* From 10:30 AM to 11:30 AM US/Pacific, Speech-to-Text (STT) experienced a spike in server errors in us-west1. The issue primarily affected control plane traffic to client STT resources (e.g. CreateRecognizer) which experienced a spike in INTERNAL server errors. At peak, around 10% of Create.* traffic or around 0.5QPS of traffic returned such errors.\n### Cloud Load Balancing\n* From 9:50 AM to 12:52 PM US/Pacific, new Cloud Load Balancer creation was failing for load balancers with backends in the us-west1 region. Also, configuration changes on the same family of products could not be made. The data plane was not affected.\n### Cloud Networking\n* From 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM US/Pacific, Cloud NAT, Cloud Router, Cloud Interconnect, and Cloud VPN users experienced time-outs for add/delete/modify operations in us-west1 region .\n* Existing programming and forwarding rules were not impacted.\n### Cloud Deploy\n* From 9:45 AM to 11:40 AM US/Pacific, Cloud Deploy releases and rollouts in the region were either delayed or failed due to the inability to create builds with Cloud Build which was also affected by the regional metadata store issue. Whether the release/rollout was delayed or failed depended on whether retrying was successful. We also saw errors creating or updating Cloud Deploy resources due to metadata store RPC errors at the time.\n### Workflows\n* From 10:10 AM to 11:30 AM US/Pacific, Cloud Workflows experienced latency and availability issues in the us-west1 region, This issue impacted ~2% of customer projects and customers experienced internal errors like deadline_exceeded: metadata store reads could not be validated after transaction function returned error: context deadline exceeded. Example methods that were impacted: CancelExecutions, CreateExecutions, CreateWorkflows and TriggerPubsubExecution.\n### Cloud Logging\n* From 9:45 AM to 12:45 PM US/Pacific, Cloud Logs ingestion storage was delayed in the us-west1 region. This issue impacted ~12.5% of global buckets, but regional buckets do not seem to have been delayed.\n### Dataform\n* From 09:55 AM to 11:40 AM US/Pacific, our business critical consumer API availability had the lowest availability of 14.29% in us-west1 during the metadata store outage.\n* The metadata store RPC Error Ratio had the highest of 57.6807%. This metadata store is used for executing customer's release & workflow schedules.\n### Certificate Authority Service\n* From 9:50 AM to 11:40 AM US/Pacific, 3% of overall traffic to Certificate Authority Service in us-west1 experienced slowness and errors for control and data plane operations. Customers experienced an error rate of 85% for Create Certificate Revocation List requests, while other operations were affected at a rate between 1-15%.\n### VPC and Serverless VPC Access\n* From 9:48 AM to 11:16 AM US/Pacific Serverless VPC Access customers in us-west1 were unable to create, delete, modify or list Serverless VPC Access Connectors. We saw error rates hovering from 50% to 90% where customers would see DEADLINE_EXCEEDED. Serverless VPC Access Connector proxying functionality was unaffected by this incident.\n### Cloud Dataflow\n* From 10:03 AM to 12:22 PM US/Pacific, Dataflow customers in us-west1 experienced job submission failures peaking at 100%. ~6% of running streaming jobs experienced unusually high system watermarks. Up to 100% of running batch jobs were stuck and failed to make progress during the outage.\n### Cloud Key Management Service\n* From 10:32 AM to 11:24 AM US/Pacific, ~0.0046% of overall traffic for Cloud Key Management Service in us-west1 served errors (INTERNAL, UNAVAILABLE, or DEADLINE_EXCEEDED) for control and crypto operations.\n* Customers experienced an error rate of 0.000189% for Crypto operations (within SLO) due to serving path redundancy with another storage system.\n* Customers experienced an error rate of 0.28% for Control operations, mostly (CreateCryptoKey, CreateKeyRing, DestroyCryptoKeyVersion) were affected, potentially any metadata read/write operations could have been affected as well. Around ~0.0219% of resource projects are believed to have been affected during the outage.\n### Persistent Disk\n* From 10:35 AM to 12:10 PM US/Pacific, some Persistent Disk deletion flows were stuck in the us-west1 region. Affected customers would have perceived very long running disk delete operations without any errors. Less than 0.01 percent of projects were affected.\n### Cloud Data Loss Prevention\n* From 10:35 AM to 11:30 AM US/Pacific, around 60% of total requests encountered errors in us-west1.\n### Cloud Dataproc\n* From 10:00 AM to 12:07 PM US/Pacific, Dataproc customers were unable to perform cluster and batch operations in us-west1. At peak impact between 10:30 AM to 11:32 AM US/Pacific, 65% of requests to Dataproc returned errors mostly DEADLINE_EXCEEDED, with some requests like create cluster returning a 100% error rate during this period.\n### Dataplex Catalog\n* From 9:45 AM to 11:35 AM US/Pacific, Dataplex Catalog customers in us-west1 were unable to create, delete, modify, list or search data stored in Dataplex Catalog. Error rates up to 90% of requests where customers would see a server error, and increased latency overall. Customers using other regions were not affected by this incident.\n### Cloud Composer\n* From 9:48 AM to ~11:28 US/Pacific, some Cloud Composer customers in us-west1 experienced issues performing control plane operations like creating/deleting/updating environments and operations requiring control plane like snapshots could have been also impacted. Composer dataplane (aka Composer environment) was operating fine.\n* The problem was discovered by Composer probers and there is an impact on SLO of Composer Control Plane API availability.\n### Instances API\n* From 10:35 AM to 11:50 AM US/Pacific, all Snapshot Schedules for Persistent Disks in us-west1 were not created according to schedule and were created with delay.\n------\n***Added on 28 Feb 2024***\n### Document AI Warehouse\n* From 11:00 AM to 11:17 AM US/Pacific, the API returned server and client error messages in the US/multi-region.\n* During the impact window, all API requests experienced elevated error rate. Overall error rate intermittently spiked beyond 90%.\n### Google Kubernetes Engine\n* From 10:47 AM to 11:32 AM US/Pacific, customers may have experienced API call failures and in some cases cluster unavailability in the us-west1 region.\n* The API call failure rate peaked at 25% of API calls to the us-west1 region and the cluster unavailability in the us-west1 region peaked at 1% of clusters.\n### GKE Fleet Management\n* From 09:52 AM to 11:40 AM US/Pacific, customers may have experienced API call failures to add GKE clusters into Fleet in the us-west1 region.\n* The API call failure rate peaked at 100% of API calls to the us-west1 region on the Fleet (GKE Hub) services\n------\nTo summarize, multiple Google Cloud Products experienced unavailability and/or elevated error rates for services in the us-west1 region during this issue. This is the final version of the Incident Report.\n------\n------",

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn 14 February 2024 from 09:45 AM to 12:52 PM US/Pacific, Google Cloud customers in us-west1 experienced control plane unavailability because of elevated latencies and errors. In addition, a few services experienced data plane unavailability for the same reason. The full list of impacted products and services are detailed below.\nTo our Google Cloud customers whose businesses were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you.\n## Root Cause\nMost Google Cloud products and services use a regional metadata store to support their internal operations. The metadata store supports critical functions such as servicing customer requests and handling scale, load balancing, admin operations and for retrieving/storing metadata including server location information.\nThe regional metadata store continuously manages load by automatically adjusting compute capacity in response to changes in demand. When usage increases, additional resources are added and load is also balanced automatically. However, an unexpected spike in demand exceeded the system’s ability to quickly provision additional resources. As a result, multiple Google Cloud products and services in the region experienced elevated latencies and errors until the unexpected load was isolated.\n## Remediation and Prevention/Detection\nGoogle engineers were alerted to this problem by our internal monitoring system and throttled the spiking workloads on the underlying regional metadata store. This allowed Google Cloud products and services to read/write state at a normal rate allowing for healthy servicing of customer requests after the backlog of operations on the regional metadata store were processed.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n- Improve monitoring and alerting for an earlier detection of unexpected spikes in the regional metadata stores.\n- Enhance the ability of regional data stores to automatically throttle workloads more aggressively when experiencing unexpected spikes.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\n### Google Compute Engine\n* From 10:30 AM to 12:30 PM US/Pacific, a number of GCE APIs returned internal or timeout errors in the us-west1 region, across all zones. The overall error rate for most APIs remained around 1% with errors affecting around 33% of projects in the region.\n* From 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM US/Pacific, less than 0.004% VMs running in the region crashed, 80% of the crashed VMs recovered while 20% of the crashed VMs experienced delays in rescheduling.\n* From 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM US/Pacific, about 1% of read/write requests in the region for [guest attributes](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/metadata/overview#guest_attributes) failed or experienced latency exceeding 1 second.\n### Google Cloud Pub/Sub Lite\n* From 10:05 AM to 12:00 PM US/Pacific, customers may have experienced elevated end-to-end latency and publish request latency in us-west1. At peak impact, 65% of publish requests in the region failed with aborted, canceled, deadline exceeded, or unavailable errors, affecting up to 47% of projects publishing in the region. Resource administrative operations also displayed unavailability in the region.\n### App Engine Standard\n* From 09:45 AM to 11:42 AM US/Pacific, ~6% of customers in the region experienced deployment failures and latency on deployments for Google App Engine apps.\n### Cloud Functions\n* From 09:45 AM to 11:42 AM US/Pacific, ~6% of customers in the region experienced deployment failures and latency on deployments for Cloud Function apps.\n### Cloud Run\n* From 09:45 AM to 11:42 AM US/Pacific, ~2% of Customers in the region experienced deployment failures and latency on deployments for Cloud Run apps.\n### Dialogflow CX\n* From 9:45 AM to 11:45 AM US/Pacific, a percentage of Dialogflow requests returned internal or timeout errors in the us-west1 region. The error rate stayed below 5% before peaking at 100% around 11:00 US/Pacific.\n### Vertex AI products:\n* From about 10:15 AM to 11:35 AM US/Pacific, all Vertex AI services that heavily rely on metadata store operations including Online Prediction, Training, and Featurestore, ML Metadata and Notebooks experienced ~50% error rates (spiking to near 100% at times) in the region.\n### Google Cloud Pub/Sub\n* From 09:57 AM to 11:26 AM US/Pacific, Cloud Pub/Sub customers with traffic in us-west1 experienced publish errors and unavailability. The publish error rate peaked at ~99% for customers with publish traffic in us-west1. In addition, backlog stats metrics were unavailable for some customers who did not have publish or subscribe traffic in us-west1.\n### Cloud Memorystore\n* From 10:05 AM and 11:35 AM US/Pacific, customers creating, updating, deleting, importing, or exporting Redis Standalone or Cluster instances in us-west1 may have experienced failures. Around 17% of such requests failed with timeouts or internal errors.\n### Eventarc\n* From 10:30 AM and 11:30 AM US/Pacific Eventarc customers in us-west1 experienced event delivery delays for up to 50 minutes as we saw event publish errors in our dataplane that peaked at 100%. There are high error ratios and latencies for all control plane long running operations with peak error rate at 100% and peak latency of 55 minutes.\n### Dataproc Metastore\n* From 10:00 AM and 11:45 AM US/Pacific, all control plane operations were sporadically returning an internal or deadline exceeded error (differing ratios throughout the outage) in the region. The peak impact was from around 10:30 AM to 11:30 AM US/Pacific where only around 3.33% of operations were completed with OK.\n### Google Cloud Tasks\n* From 10:40 AM and 11:30 AM US/Pacific, Cloud Tasks’s main data operation (CreateTask) returned DEADLINE_EXCEEDED error for all requests in us-west1. This means customers in this region were not able to buffer Tasks and, subsequently, our system was not able to dispatch them.\n### Cloud Build\n* From 9:45 AM to 12:00 PM US/Pacific, using Cloud Build to create or retry builds may have failed in us-west1. ~15-20% of requests failed during the issue.\n### Cloud SQL\n* From 10:06 AM to 11:46 AM US/Pacific, Many operations requiring the regional metadata store in us-west1 timed out or failed, this affected Cloud SQL instance creations or any modifications to existing us-west1 instances. 30% of instance creations failed, 10% of export operations failed, and <10% of update operations failed in us-west1.\n### Speech-to-text\n* From 10:30 AM to 11:30 AM US/Pacific, Speech-to-Text (STT) experienced a spike in server errors in us-west1. The issue primarily affected control plane traffic to client STT resources (e.g. CreateRecognizer) which experienced a spike in INTERNAL server errors. At peak, around 10% of Create.* traffic or around 0.5QPS of traffic returned such errors.\n### Cloud Load Balancing\n* From 9:50 AM to 12:52 PM US/Pacific, new Cloud Load Balancer creation was failing for load balancers with backends in the us-west1 region. Also, configuration changes on the same family of products could not be made. The data plane was not affected.\n### Cloud Networking\n* From 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM US/Pacific, Cloud NAT, Cloud Router, Cloud Interconnect, and Cloud VPN users experienced time-outs for add/delete/modify operations in us-west1 region .\n* Existing programming and forwarding rules were not impacted.\n### Cloud Deploy\n* From 9:45 AM to 11:40 AM US/Pacific, Cloud Deploy releases and rollouts in the region were either delayed or failed due to the inability to create builds with Cloud Build which was also affected by the regional metadata store issue. Whether the release/rollout was delayed or failed depended on whether retrying was successful. We also saw errors creating or updating Cloud Deploy resources due to metadata store RPC errors at the time.\n### Workflows\n* From 10:10 AM to 11:30 AM US/Pacific, Cloud Workflows experienced latency and availability issues in the us-west1 region, This issue impacted ~2% of customer projects and customers experienced internal errors like deadline_exceeded: metadata store reads could not be validated after transaction function returned error: context deadline exceeded. Example methods that were impacted: CancelExecutions, CreateExecutions, CreateWorkflows and TriggerPubsubExecution.\n### Cloud Logging\n* From 9:45 AM to 12:45 PM US/Pacific, Cloud Logs ingestion storage was delayed in the us-west1 region. This issue impacted ~12.5% of global buckets, but regional buckets do not seem to have been delayed.\n### Dataform\n* From 09:55 AM to 11:40 AM US/Pacific, our business critical consumer API availability had the lowest availability of 14.29% in us-west1 during the metadata store outage.\n* The metadata store RPC Error Ratio had the highest of 57.6807%. This metadata store is used for executing customer's release & workflow schedules.\n### Certificate Authority Service\n* From 9:50 AM to 11:40 AM US/Pacific, 3% of overall traffic to Certificate Authority Service in us-west1 experienced slowness and errors for control and data plane operations. Customers experienced an error rate of 85% for Create Certificate Revocation List requests, while other operations were affected at a rate between 1-15%.\n### VPC and Serverless VPC Access\n* From 9:48 AM to 11:16 AM US/Pacific Serverless VPC Access customers in us-west1 were unable to create, delete, modify or list Serverless VPC Access Connectors. We saw error rates hovering from 50% to 90% where customers would see DEADLINE_EXCEEDED. Serverless VPC Access Connector proxying functionality was unaffected by this incident.\n### Cloud Dataflow\n* From 10:03 AM to 12:22 PM US/Pacific, Dataflow customers in us-west1 experienced job submission failures peaking at 100%. ~6% of running streaming jobs experienced unusually high system watermarks. Up to 100% of running batch jobs were stuck and failed to make progress during the outage.\n### Cloud Key Management Service\n* From 10:32 AM to 11:24 AM US/Pacific, ~0.0046% of overall traffic for Cloud Key Management Service in us-west1 served errors (INTERNAL, UNAVAILABLE, or DEADLINE_EXCEEDED) for control and crypto operations.\n* Customers experienced an error rate of 0.000189% for Crypto operations (within SLO) due to serving path redundancy with another storage system.\n* Customers experienced an error rate of 0.28% for Control operations, mostly (CreateCryptoKey, CreateKeyRing, DestroyCryptoKeyVersion) were affected, potentially any metadata read/write operations could have been affected as well. Around ~0.0219% of resource projects are believed to have been affected during the outage.\n### Persistent Disk\n* From 10:35 AM to 12:10 PM US/Pacific, some Persistent Disk deletion flows were stuck in the us-west1 region. Affected customers would have perceived very long running disk delete operations without any errors. Less than 0.01 percent of projects were affected.\n### Cloud Data Loss Prevention\n* From 10:35 AM to 11:30 AM US/Pacific, around 60% of total requests encountered errors in us-west1.\n### Cloud Dataproc\n* From 10:00 AM to 12:07 PM US/Pacific, Dataproc customers were unable to perform cluster and batch operations in us-west1. At peak impact between 10:30 AM to 11:32 AM US/Pacific, 65% of requests to Dataproc returned errors mostly DEADLINE_EXCEEDED, with some requests like create cluster returning a 100% error rate during this period.\n### Dataplex Catalog\n* From 9:45 AM to 11:35 AM US/Pacific, Dataplex Catalog customers in us-west1 were unable to create, delete, modify, list or search data stored in Dataplex Catalog. Error rates up to 90% of requests where customers would see a server error, and increased latency overall. Customers using other regions were not affected by this incident.\n### Cloud Composer\n* From 9:48 AM to ~11:28 US/Pacific, some Cloud Composer customers in us-west1 experienced issues performing control plane operations like creating/deleting/updating environments and operations requiring control plane like snapshots could have been also impacted. Composer dataplane (aka Composer environment) was operating fine.\n* The problem was discovered by Composer probers and there is an impact on SLO of Composer Control Plane API availability.\n### Instances API\n* From 10:35 AM to 11:50 AM US/Pacific, all Snapshot Schedules for Persistent Disks in us-west1 were not created according to schedule and were created with delay.\n------\n***Added on 28 Feb 2024***\n### Document AI Warehouse\n* From 11:00 AM to 11:17 AM US/Pacific, the API returned server and client error messages in the US/multi-region.\n* During the impact window, all API requests experienced elevated error rate. Overall error rate intermittently spiked beyond 90%.\n### Google Kubernetes Engine\n* From 10:47 AM to 11:32 AM US/Pacific, customers may have experienced API call failures and in some cases cluster unavailability in the us-west1 region.\n* The API call failure rate peaked at 25% of API calls to the us-west1 region and the cluster unavailability in the us-west1 region peaked at 1% of clusters.\n### GKE Fleet Management\n* From 09:52 AM to 11:40 AM US/Pacific, customers may have experienced API call failures to add GKE clusters into Fleet in the us-west1 region.\n* The API call failure rate peaked at 100% of API calls to the us-west1 region on the Fleet (GKE Hub) services\n------\nTo summarize, multiple Google Cloud Products experienced unavailability and/or elevated error rates for services in the us-west1 region during this issue. This is the final version of the Incident Report.\n------\n------",

        "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn 7 February 2024, multiple Google Cloud services experienced a partial zonal service outage in the europe-west8-b zone for a duration of 1 hour, 8 minutes. To our customers whose services were impacted during this service outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe europe-west8 region recently received a networking upgrade to increase capacity and improve resilience. In order to minimize the risk, Google executes these as \"make-before-break,\" adding new capacity before decommissioning old capacity. The final step of this upgrade was to remove now-unused fiber connections between zones in the region. Deployment automation creates work orders for onsite technicians to remove unused fiber cabling from network devices and fiber patch panels.\nOn 7 February 2024, between 02:21 and 02:46 US/Pacific, onsite technicians performing this planned network maintenance inadvertently unplugged several fibers that were adjacent to those in the work order, but still in use for production traffic. As a result, a portion of the europe-west8-b zone unintentionally became isolated from a portion of the backbone network at 02:46 US/Pacific.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the partial outage via internal monitoring on 7 February 2024, 02:56 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Once the nature and scope of the issue became clear, Google engineers began reverting the fiber changes and restoring network capacity at 03:52 US/Pacific.\nSufficient capacity to serve customer traffic was restored by 03:54 US/Pacific, mitigating impact to the affected products. Full capacity was restored by 04:07 US/Pacific.\nGoogle is committed to preventing recurrence of this incident. The following actions have been identified:\n* Google engineers have paused all work of this kind globally, starting on 8 February 2024. This pause will remain in effect until the actions below have been implemented to reduce the risk of recurrence.\n* Complete the rollout of an enhanced physical work safety program, which includes updates to the current process for execution of planned work related to interfaces or devices serving customer traffic. The following action items within that program are relevant to this incident: * Creation of an automated notification system for the start / end of planned work related to interfaces or devices serving customer traffic. * Division of planned work into execution batches. * Require operational team supervision and monitoring for planned work. * Add multi-step verification of traffic status before fibers are disconnected. * Include additional controls as part of working procedures for the execution of critical tasks to ensure compliance with documented processes.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn 7 February 2024, from 02:46 to 03:54 US/Pacific, multiple Google Cloud services experienced a partial zonal service outage for europe-west8-b. Affected services included:\n**Google Kubernetes Engine**\n* GKE clusters in europe-west8-b were unavailable.\n* Customers may also have experienced failures when attempting to create, delete, or modify VMs in the affected zone.\n**Cloud Key Management Service (KMS)**\n* Cloud KMS experienced a partial zonal outage for services in europe-west8-b, including Hardware Security Module (HSM), External Key Manager (EKM), Secret Manager, and Private CA.\n**Google Cloud Bigtable**\n* Customers experienced a service outage with non-high availability instances in europe-west8-b for the duration of the outage.\n**Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**\n* VPC customers may have experienced increased packet loss in the affected zone.\n**Google Cloud Deploy**\n* Customers in europe-west8-b would have experienced errors creating rollouts and releases.\n**Google Compute Engine**\n* VMs in a subset of europe-west8-b were unreachable for the duration of the outage.\n* VM creations and deletions in europe-west8-c started failing as services failed over to that zone.\n**Persistent Disk (PD)**\n* PD devices in a subset of europe-west8-b would have been unavailable for the duration of the outage.\n* PD services related to snapshots, creation of new disks, and image creation for the affected zone would have experienced failures.\n* A small number of VMs with Persistent Disks in a different zone within the region saw guest errors.\n**Google Cloud Networking**\n* Cloud NAT, Cloud Interconnect, Cloud VPN, Cloud VR were unavailable for europe-west8-b.\n* Cloud Network programming was delayed for all customers in the europe-west8-b zone.\n**Service Directory**\n* Customers in europe-west8-b experienced read and write errors for the duration of the outage.\n**Traffic Director**\n* Stale configurations and load balancing assignments for all customers in europe-west8-b. This would have appeared as configuration updates not propagating and load balancing assignments not reacting to changes in load.\n* All newly restarted clients would have been unable to load configuration and receive load balancing assignments.\n**Cloud Load Balancing**\n* Approximately 50% of load balancers/target pools in europe-west8-b were unreachable.\n* Customers with Load Balancers configured in this zone would find them inconsistently available. If no Load Balancers were configured and available in another zone or region, requests to the customer's project would result in 500 errors.\n**Google Cloud DNS**\n* Customers in europe-west8-b would have been unable to write new DNS records for the duration of the outage.\n* Cloud DNS public name servers were unreachable from europe-west8-b during the outage, and intermittently unreachable from other zones in the region as a result of throttling as traffic moved from europe-west8-b to other zones in region\n**Memorystore for Redis**\n* Cloud Redis Standalone instances in europe-west8-b were unavailable for the duration of the outage.\n**Cloud BigQuery**\n* A small number of projects (one customer) may have experienced errors for API calls for a period of approximately 15 minutes for the tabledata.insertAll API. A very low error rate might have been present for jobs.insert and jobs.query operations as well, but these were mitigated much quicker through automatic recovery mechanisms.\n**Cloud Dataflow**\n* A small number of customer projects may have experienced stuck streaming jobs in europe-west8-b during the duration of the incident.\n**Cloud Build**\n* Builds would have terminated with status “INTERNAL_ERROR” for approximately 20% of builds in europe-west8 for the first approximately 20 minutes of the outage. Intra-region failover healed the user impact thereafter.\n**Cloud SQL**\n* A small number of instance create operations failed in the europe-west8 region.\n* Existing HA instances were moved to a healthy zone to restore connectivity.\n* Existing Zonal instances in europe-west8-b would have remained unavailable for the duration of the outage.\n**Cloud Armor**\n* Propagation of updates to Cloud Armor Security policies in Cloud Console stalled globally.\n**Cloud Filestore**\n* Up to 100% error rates for CreateBackup, CreateInstance, CreateSnapshot, and DeleteInstance operations for europe-west8-b zone.\n* Zonal instances in the affected zone were unavailable.",

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn 7 February 2024, multiple Google Cloud services experienced a partial zonal service outage in the europe-west8-b zone for a duration of 1 hour, 8 minutes. To our customers whose services were impacted during this service outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe europe-west8 region recently received a networking upgrade to increase capacity and improve resilience. In order to minimize the risk, Google executes these as \"make-before-break,\" adding new capacity before decommissioning old capacity. The final step of this upgrade was to remove now-unused fiber connections between zones in the region. Deployment automation creates work orders for onsite technicians to remove unused fiber cabling from network devices and fiber patch panels.\nOn 7 February 2024, between 02:21 and 02:46 US/Pacific, onsite technicians performing this planned network maintenance inadvertently unplugged several fibers that were adjacent to those in the work order, but still in use for production traffic. As a result, a portion of the europe-west8-b zone unintentionally became isolated from a portion of the backbone network at 02:46 US/Pacific.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the partial outage via internal monitoring on 7 February 2024, 02:56 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Once the nature and scope of the issue became clear, Google engineers began reverting the fiber changes and restoring network capacity at 03:52 US/Pacific.\nSufficient capacity to serve customer traffic was restored by 03:54 US/Pacific, mitigating impact to the affected products. Full capacity was restored by 04:07 US/Pacific.\nGoogle is committed to preventing recurrence of this incident. The following actions have been identified:\n* Google engineers have paused all work of this kind globally, starting on 8 February 2024. This pause will remain in effect until the actions below have been implemented to reduce the risk of recurrence.\n* Complete the rollout of an enhanced physical work safety program, which includes updates to the current process for execution of planned work related to interfaces or devices serving customer traffic. The following action items within that program are relevant to this incident: * Creation of an automated notification system for the start / end of planned work related to interfaces or devices serving customer traffic. * Division of planned work into execution batches. * Require operational team supervision and monitoring for planned work. * Add multi-step verification of traffic status before fibers are disconnected. * Include additional controls as part of working procedures for the execution of critical tasks to ensure compliance with documented processes.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn 7 February 2024, from 02:46 to 03:54 US/Pacific, multiple Google Cloud services experienced a partial zonal service outage for europe-west8-b. Affected services included:\n**Google Kubernetes Engine**\n* GKE clusters in europe-west8-b were unavailable.\n* Customers may also have experienced failures when attempting to create, delete, or modify VMs in the affected zone.\n**Cloud Key Management Service (KMS)**\n* Cloud KMS experienced a partial zonal outage for services in europe-west8-b, including Hardware Security Module (HSM), External Key Manager (EKM), Secret Manager, and Private CA.\n**Google Cloud Bigtable**\n* Customers experienced a service outage with non-high availability instances in europe-west8-b for the duration of the outage.\n**Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**\n* VPC customers may have experienced increased packet loss in the affected zone.\n**Google Cloud Deploy**\n* Customers in europe-west8-b would have experienced errors creating rollouts and releases.\n**Google Compute Engine**\n* VMs in a subset of europe-west8-b were unreachable for the duration of the outage.\n* VM creations and deletions in europe-west8-c started failing as services failed over to that zone.\n**Persistent Disk (PD)**\n* PD devices in a subset of europe-west8-b would have been unavailable for the duration of the outage.\n* PD services related to snapshots, creation of new disks, and image creation for the affected zone would have experienced failures.\n* A small number of VMs with Persistent Disks in a different zone within the region saw guest errors.\n**Google Cloud Networking**\n* Cloud NAT, Cloud Interconnect, Cloud VPN, Cloud VR were unavailable for europe-west8-b.\n* Cloud Network programming was delayed for all customers in the europe-west8-b zone.\n**Service Directory**\n* Customers in europe-west8-b experienced read and write errors for the duration of the outage.\n**Traffic Director**\n* Stale configurations and load balancing assignments for all customers in europe-west8-b. This would have appeared as configuration updates not propagating and load balancing assignments not reacting to changes in load.\n* All newly restarted clients would have been unable to load configuration and receive load balancing assignments.\n**Cloud Load Balancing**\n* Approximately 50% of load balancers/target pools in europe-west8-b were unreachable.\n* Customers with Load Balancers configured in this zone would find them inconsistently available. If no Load Balancers were configured and available in another zone or region, requests to the customer's project would result in 500 errors.\n**Google Cloud DNS**\n* Customers in europe-west8-b would have been unable to write new DNS records for the duration of the outage.\n* Cloud DNS public name servers were unreachable from europe-west8-b during the outage, and intermittently unreachable from other zones in the region as a result of throttling as traffic moved from europe-west8-b to other zones in region\n**Memorystore for Redis**\n* Cloud Redis Standalone instances in europe-west8-b were unavailable for the duration of the outage.\n**Cloud BigQuery**\n* A small number of projects (one customer) may have experienced errors for API calls for a period of approximately 15 minutes for the tabledata.insertAll API. A very low error rate might have been present for jobs.insert and jobs.query operations as well, but these were mitigated much quicker through automatic recovery mechanisms.\n**Cloud Dataflow**\n* A small number of customer projects may have experienced stuck streaming jobs in europe-west8-b during the duration of the incident.\n**Cloud Build**\n* Builds would have terminated with status “INTERNAL_ERROR” for approximately 20% of builds in europe-west8 for the first approximately 20 minutes of the outage. Intra-region failover healed the user impact thereafter.\n**Cloud SQL**\n* A small number of instance create operations failed in the europe-west8 region.\n* Existing HA instances were moved to a healthy zone to restore connectivity.\n* Existing Zonal instances in europe-west8-b would have remained unavailable for the duration of the outage.\n**Cloud Armor**\n* Propagation of updates to Cloud Armor Security policies in Cloud Console stalled globally.\n**Cloud Filestore**\n* Up to 100% error rates for CreateBackup, CreateInstance, CreateSnapshot, and DeleteInstance operations for europe-west8-b zone.\n* Zonal instances in the affected zone were unavailable.",

        "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn Tuesday, 23 January 2024 at 09:30 PT, Cloud Logging, and Google Cloud products and services that rely on Cloud Logging, experienced delays ingesting logs originating from us-central1, us-east1, europe-west1, europe-north1, and asia-east1. This resulted in customers not being able to view these logs in Google Cloud Console or other places that make use of the logging query APIs during the impact windows for each region:\n* us-central1:\t9:30-13:30 PT (4h)\n* us-east1:\t9:30-10:20 PT (50m)\n* europe-west1:\t9:30-14:15 PT (4h45m)\n* europe-north1:\t9:30-14:15 PT (4h45m)\n* asia-east1:\t9:30-10:10 PT (40m)\nExports of logs as well as writing to log-based metrics were also delayed in these regions during the impact windows. The issue also affected alerting through Cloud Console for Personalized Service Health (PSH).\nTo our Google Cloud customers who were affected, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe first time data is received for a log bucket that has Log Analytics enabled, Cloud Logging dynamically provisions resources necessary to ingest and store logs in BigQuery for that bucket. This requires updating state in a configuration database, which is accessed during log ingestion and routing. This configuration is required to ensure data is stored in compliance with each customer's organization settings.\nAs part of ongoing feature development, Cloud Logging Engineers increased traffic from a new set of projects to Log Analytics. These projects were ingesting logs in multiple regions and the ramp-up resulted in a large number of concurrent dynamic provisioning requests in the five regions listed above. This caused contention and slowdowns accessing the configuration database. While the Log Router has a load-shedding mechanism to protect against loss of throughput in such situations, there was a previously unknown latent issue that caused the problematic traffic to not be isolated quickly enough in a separate buffer. As a result, Log Router throughput was reduced by about 40% in the impacted regions, causing a log processing backlog to form.\nThe primary impact was that recently written logs were not visible to queries and log exports were delayed for log data originating from any of the impacted regions. This delay also affected Log Analytics, log-based metrics, and other Google products and services that rely on log data, including Personalized Service Health. No log entries were permanently lost, and all log entries were eventually successfully ingested, indexed for queries, and exported to configured destinations.\nTo quickly process the large backlog of data, the Log Analytics ingesters and log-based metrics pipeline were scaled up. This scale up led to two additional unintended secondary impacts.\n* **Log-based Metrics:** Queries for some log-based metrics with high cardinality were degraded for some users for about 25 hours following the event start time of 09:30 PT on 23 January 2024. Queries for such log-based metrics would timeout if the query time interval overlapped with the interval containing high cardinality values, as it is less efficient to store and query high cardinality data points. The internal cardinality of the metrics were increased because the writer tasks had scaled up to ingest the backlog and there was an increased number of late arriving logs. The issue was resolved when the high cardinality data aged out of the 25 hour in-memory retention window.\n* **Log Analytics:** Queries in Log Analytics would not return recently ingested data during the outage period until 24 January 2024 02:00 PT because the ingester scale up led to exceeding an internal connection quota limit.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage via a support case and internal alerts on Tuesday, 23 January 2024 09:55 PT and immediately started an investigation. Once they determined that the feature ramp-up was the cause of the outage, they rolled back the feature ramp-up at 11:15 PT. This reduced contention but the recovery process was slow because the backlog already contained many logs that triggered provisioning. A change was then rolled out to accelerate the recovery of the impacted regions by disabling provisioning for the affected logs. The rollout completed by 13:40 PT, and the backlog was fully processed in all impacted regions by 14:15 PT.\nTo remediate the log-based metrics issue, Google engineers scaled down the number of writer tasks to reduce cardinality of the generated metrics. The degraded query performance was mitigated by 24 January 2024 22:00 PT as the high cardinality data aged out of the in-memory retention window.\nTo remediate the issue in Log Analytics, Google engineers raised the internal connection quota and changed the connection type used by the buffer processor from exclusive connections to shared multiplexed connections. These changes mitigated the issue for Log Analytics and the buffered logs were fully processed by 24 January 2024 02:00 PT. The mitigation will also reduce the likelihood of a future occurrence of connection quota issues in Log Analytics.\nGoogle is committed to preventing recurrence of this incident. The following actions are in progress:\n* Change the rollout process used to implement these types of traffic ramp-ups, to reduce the blast radius of any issues that result.\n* Reduce the timeout for database operations in the Log Router, to ensure that problematic data is isolated more quickly.\n* Implement fault injection testing under load to verify that Log Router throughput can be maintained during both failures and slow operation of the configuration database.\n* Change the dynamic provisioning process to eliminate this dependency from the log routing critical path.\n* Improve monitoring, alerting, and playbooks so engineers are notified of and able to respond to log entry backlogs more quickly.\n* Improve the log-based metrics pipeline processing to reduce the cardinality issues that were caused by scaling up writers to consume the backlog.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\n### Cloud Logging\n* Log ingestion in Cloud Logging was delayed for logs ingested from us-central1, us-east1, europe-west1, europe-north1, and asia-east1 regions. Ingestion of logs from other regions was not impacted. The following are the impact windows for each affected region on 23 January 2024: * us-central1:\t9:30-13:30 PT (4h)\t~50% of messages * us-east1:\t9:30-10:20 PT (50m)\t~40% of messages * europe-west1:\t9:30-14:15 PT (4h45m)\t~75% of messages * europe-north1:\t9:30-14:15 PT (4h45m)\t~1% of messages * asia-east1:\t9:30-10:10 PT (40m)\t~20% of messages\n* Queries of logs from the impacted regions would not return recently written data during the outage period.\n* Exports of logs from the impacted regions to BigQuery, GCS, and Cloud PubSub destinations were delayed.\n* Graphs and queries for log-based metrics may have appeared to have missing or incomplete data during the outage period. Alerts that depended on this data may have been missed.\n* Log-based metrics queries for some high cardinality metrics experienced degraded performance for some users for about 25 hours following the event due to in-memory retention of high cardinality data.\n* No logs were lost during the incident. However some log-based metrics, derived from the logs, may have gaps in the corresponding data points during the outage period.\n* Ingestion to Log Analytics was degraded for a duration of 12 hours.\n### Personalized Service Health\n* PSH Alerting through Cloud Console would have been unavailable during the impact windows for each affected region.\n* Additionally, messages written by PSH to Cloud Logging were also delayed for the affected regions.\n* The ability to view incident status on the PSH Dashboard and integrations to the PSH API were not impacted.",

        "text": "# Mini Incident Report\nWe apologize for the inconvenience this service outage may have caused. We would like to provide some information about this incident below. Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 23 Jan, 2024 09:30\n**Incident End for us-east1 logs delay:** 23 Jan 2024 10:20\n**Incident End for us-central1 logs delay:** 23 Jan 2024 13:45\n**Incident End for europe-west1 logs delay:** 23 Jan 2024 14:15\n**Incident End for Cloud Metrics backfill :** 23 Jan, 2024 18:05\n**Cumulative Duration:** 8 hours, 35 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\n- Google Cloud Logging\n- Cloud Dataflow\n- Personalized Service Health\n- Google Cloud products and services that rely on Cloud Logging.\n**Regions/Zones:** us-central1, europe-west1, us-east1\n**Description:**\nCloud Logging experienced delays ingesting logs that originated from us-central1, us-east1, and europe-west1 resulting in customers not being able to view these logs during that time in Google Cloud Console or other places that make use of the Logging query APIs. Exports of logs as well as writing to [log-based metrics](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/logs-based-metrics) were also delayed during this period.\nIngestion delays in Cloud Logging had a downstream impact on Google Cloud products and services that rely on Cloud Logging.\nFrom our preliminary investigations, the root cause of the issue is a roll out of an internal feature for Cloud Trace that uses Cloud Logging. The rollout of the new feature caused an unexpected contention in accessing the configuration database used for Log Routing, which caused a backlog in the ingestion pipeline.\nThe issue was mitigated by rolling back the internal feature of Cloud Trace which concluded at 13:45 US/Pacific and the logs in the pending queue were gradually processed, mitigating the delayed logs issue by 14:15 US/Pacific. The issue with log-based metrics where the logs were not written to corresponding data points was mitigated at 18:05 US/Pacific.\nGoogle will complete a full Incident Report in the following days to provide a full root cause.\n**Customer Impact:**\n**Impact to Google Cloud products and services:**\n* Log ingestion in Cloud Logging was delayed for logs ingested from us-central1, europe-west1, and us-east1. Ingestion of logs from other regions was not impacted.\n* Log queries, exports of logs (to BigQuery, GCS, or Cloud PubSub destinations), and writing corresponding data points to [log-based metrics](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/logs-based-metrics) were delayed for the three impacted regions.\n* No logs were lost during the incident. However some [log-based metrics](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/logs-based-metrics), derived from the logs, may have gaps in the corresponding data points during the outage period.\n**Impact to Personalized Service Health (PSH):**\n* The PSH dashboard displayed outage status, however the notification system to customers was down during the incident.\n* In addition to this, the log messages written by PSH were also impacted in the locations above.\n* Integrations to the PSH API were not impacted.\n**Additional Information:**\n* A subset of customers are experiencing delays with querying historical log-based metrics data and our engineers are continuing to work on resolving the issue for those customers via a separate incident.\n------------------------------",

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn Tuesday, 23 January 2024 at 09:30 PT, Cloud Logging, and Google Cloud products and services that rely on Cloud Logging, experienced delays ingesting logs originating from us-central1, us-east1, europe-west1, europe-north1, and asia-east1. This resulted in customers not being able to view these logs in Google Cloud Console or other places that make use of the logging query APIs during the impact windows for each region:\n* us-central1:\t9:30-13:30 PT (4h)\n* us-east1:\t9:30-10:20 PT (50m)\n* europe-west1:\t9:30-14:15 PT (4h45m)\n* europe-north1:\t9:30-14:15 PT (4h45m)\n* asia-east1:\t9:30-10:10 PT (40m)\nExports of logs as well as writing to log-based metrics were also delayed in these regions during the impact windows. The issue also affected alerting through Cloud Console for Personalized Service Health (PSH).\nTo our Google Cloud customers who were affected, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe first time data is received for a log bucket that has Log Analytics enabled, Cloud Logging dynamically provisions resources necessary to ingest and store logs in BigQuery for that bucket. This requires updating state in a configuration database, which is accessed during log ingestion and routing. This configuration is required to ensure data is stored in compliance with each customer's organization settings.\nAs part of ongoing feature development, Cloud Logging Engineers increased traffic from a new set of projects to Log Analytics. These projects were ingesting logs in multiple regions and the ramp-up resulted in a large number of concurrent dynamic provisioning requests in the five regions listed above. This caused contention and slowdowns accessing the configuration database. While the Log Router has a load-shedding mechanism to protect against loss of throughput in such situations, there was a previously unknown latent issue that caused the problematic traffic to not be isolated quickly enough in a separate buffer. As a result, Log Router throughput was reduced by about 40% in the impacted regions, causing a log processing backlog to form.\nThe primary impact was that recently written logs were not visible to queries and log exports were delayed for log data originating from any of the impacted regions. This delay also affected Log Analytics, log-based metrics, and other Google products and services that rely on log data, including Personalized Service Health. No log entries were permanently lost, and all log entries were eventually successfully ingested, indexed for queries, and exported to configured destinations.\nTo quickly process the large backlog of data, the Log Analytics ingesters and log-based metrics pipeline were scaled up. This scale up led to two additional unintended secondary impacts.\n* **Log-based Metrics:** Queries for some log-based metrics with high cardinality were degraded for some users for about 25 hours following the event start time of 09:30 PT on 23 January 2024. Queries for such log-based metrics would timeout if the query time interval overlapped with the interval containing high cardinality values, as it is less efficient to store and query high cardinality data points. The internal cardinality of the metrics were increased because the writer tasks had scaled up to ingest the backlog and there was an increased number of late arriving logs. The issue was resolved when the high cardinality data aged out of the 25 hour in-memory retention window.\n* **Log Analytics:** Queries in Log Analytics would not return recently ingested data during the outage period until 24 January 2024 02:00 PT because the ingester scale up led to exceeding an internal connection quota limit.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage via a support case and internal alerts on Tuesday, 23 January 2024 09:55 PT and immediately started an investigation. Once they determined that the feature ramp-up was the cause of the outage, they rolled back the feature ramp-up at 11:15 PT. This reduced contention but the recovery process was slow because the backlog already contained many logs that triggered provisioning. A change was then rolled out to accelerate the recovery of the impacted regions by disabling provisioning for the affected logs. The rollout completed by 13:40 PT, and the backlog was fully processed in all impacted regions by 14:15 PT.\nTo remediate the log-based metrics issue, Google engineers scaled down the number of writer tasks to reduce cardinality of the generated metrics. The degraded query performance was mitigated by 24 January 2024 22:00 PT as the high cardinality data aged out of the in-memory retention window.\nTo remediate the issue in Log Analytics, Google engineers raised the internal connection quota and changed the connection type used by the buffer processor from exclusive connections to shared multiplexed connections. These changes mitigated the issue for Log Analytics and the buffered logs were fully processed by 24 January 2024 02:00 PT. The mitigation will also reduce the likelihood of a future occurrence of connection quota issues in Log Analytics.\nGoogle is committed to preventing recurrence of this incident. The following actions are in progress:\n* Change the rollout process used to implement these types of traffic ramp-ups, to reduce the blast radius of any issues that result.\n* Reduce the timeout for database operations in the Log Router, to ensure that problematic data is isolated more quickly.\n* Implement fault injection testing under load to verify that Log Router throughput can be maintained during both failures and slow operation of the configuration database.\n* Change the dynamic provisioning process to eliminate this dependency from the log routing critical path.\n* Improve monitoring, alerting, and playbooks so engineers are notified of and able to respond to log entry backlogs more quickly.\n* Improve the log-based metrics pipeline processing to reduce the cardinality issues that were caused by scaling up writers to consume the backlog.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\n### Cloud Logging\n* Log ingestion in Cloud Logging was delayed for logs ingested from us-central1, us-east1, europe-west1, europe-north1, and asia-east1 regions. Ingestion of logs from other regions was not impacted. The following are the impact windows for each affected region on 23 January 2024: * us-central1:\t9:30-13:30 PT (4h)\t~50% of messages * us-east1:\t9:30-10:20 PT (50m)\t~40% of messages * europe-west1:\t9:30-14:15 PT (4h45m)\t~75% of messages * europe-north1:\t9:30-14:15 PT (4h45m)\t~1% of messages * asia-east1:\t9:30-10:10 PT (40m)\t~20% of messages\n* Queries of logs from the impacted regions would not return recently written data during the outage period.\n* Exports of logs from the impacted regions to BigQuery, GCS, and Cloud PubSub destinations were delayed.\n* Graphs and queries for log-based metrics may have appeared to have missing or incomplete data during the outage period. Alerts that depended on this data may have been missed.\n* Log-based metrics queries for some high cardinality metrics experienced degraded performance for some users for about 25 hours following the event due to in-memory retention of high cardinality data.\n* No logs were lost during the incident. However some log-based metrics, derived from the logs, may have gaps in the corresponding data points during the outage period.\n* Ingestion to Log Analytics was degraded for a duration of 12 hours.\n### Personalized Service Health\n* PSH Alerting through Cloud Console would have been unavailable during the impact windows for each affected region.\n* Additionally, messages written by PSH to Cloud Logging were also delayed for the affected regions.\n* The ability to view incident status on the PSH Dashboard and integrations to the PSH API were not impacted.",

During the incident there was a workaround provided; customers were able to use “call the API” to do training instead of doing it on UI.\nFrom preliminary analysis the root cause of the issue was a rollout misalignment. This was fixed by speeding up the rollout, which was then completed successfully, resolving impact.\n**Customer Impact:**\nDuring the incident customers may have experienced:\n- Failed training requests on Document AI custom extractor with an error \"Internal error encountered\" on UI.\n- Direct API calls were not affected.",

To our Google Cloud Monitoring and Google Cloud Products customers who were affected, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nGoogle Cloud Monitoring experienced two distinct issues that impacted system metric data for most Google Cloud Products.\nMetric Data Queries:\nMetric data is stored in-memory prior to being stored on-disk. Initial degradation started on 09 January 2024 8:30 am PST, due to data staleness. A configuration change in data replication for us-central1 triggered a bottleneck in the pipeline responsible for moving data to disk for querying. Initially, this bottleneck induced backlog did not cause user-visible impact, given data continued to be served from the in-memory tier for the most recent 24h.\nWhen the pipeline blockage was mitigated 10 January 2024 8:00 am PST, the entire 20 hours backlog of files was rapidly ingested into the system that serves queries from disk. But, the resulting huge number of files triggered yet-another bottleneck in the on-disk system, causing high latency or failure for most queries.\nMetric Data Unavailability:\nA combination of two changes - one permissions-related and another scheduling-related - caused certain Cloud Metrics to be unavailable.\nThese changes were rolled out on 03 January 2024 11:23 PST. The impact from these changes was limited initially, but when mitigation was attempted on 09 January 2024 2:07 PST, it induced a bigger issue. The new problem surfaced due to a higher rate of server restarts.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nMetric Data Queries:\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the (not yet user-visible) data staleness issue by internal SLIs (Service Level Indicators) on 09 January 2024 16:58 PST and immediately started an investigation. Staleness began 09 January 2024 08:30:00 PST. When the high latency replica was removed at 10 January 2024 07:23 PST, the processing pipeline returned to normalcy.\nWhile response to this first issue was still ongoing, engineers were alerted by user-facing SLIs 10 January 2024 07:29 PST of user-visible query unavailability that had begun at 07:23 PST. They reconfigured the system to remove bottlenecks and increased the overall amount of compute resources available. This eventually reduced the backlog and returned to normalcy. All query availability/latency SLI also recovered fully at 12 January 2024 03:15 PST.\nMetric Data Unavailability:\nGoogle engineers were alerted by SLIs (Service Level Indicators) 09 January 2024 23:51 PST and immediately started an investigation.\nThe initial attempt at mitigating the problem caused wider issues. We stopped this mitigation and re-applied a newer patch that fixed the root-cause correctly. All remaining errors were resolved on 10 January 2024 16:40 PST.\nRemediation:\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n* Right-size the ingestion backlog processing that keeps up with load demand without affecting query availability.\n* Reassess and address the ingestion pipeline for bottlenecks that might induce this or related backlog issues.\n* Revisit the process for applying mitigations with better health indicators for side-effects.",

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Metric data unavailability:** * **Low impact window start:** 03 January, 2024 11:23 * **Low impact window end :** 10 January, 2024 09:30 * **Duration:** 6 days, 22 hours, 7 minutes. * **Significant impact window start:** 10 January, 2024 09:30 * **Significant impact window end:** 10 January, 2024 16:45 * **Duration:** 7 hours, 15 minutes\n**Metric data queries issue start:** 10 January, 2024 07:23\n**Metric data queries issue end:** 12 January, 2024 03:08\n**Duration:** 1 day, 19 hours, 45 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nGoogle Cloud Monitoring and All Google Cloud Products that expose Google Cloud Monitoring.\n**Regions/Zones:** Global\n**Description:**\nGoogle Cloud Monitoring experienced two distinct issues (metric data unavailability, metric data query failures) that impacted system metric data for most Google Cloud Products.\nBetween 03 January 2024, 11:23 and 10 January 2024, 16:45 US/Pacific a small number of Google Cloud Monitoring users experienced sporadic issues where metric data was unavailable creating gaps in the metric data. From preliminary analysis, the root cause was a rollout to increase the monitoring platform’s reliability, which inadvertently introduced an issue that is triggered upon monitoring server restart.\nBetween 03 January 11:23 and 10 January 09:30 US/Pacific, the rate of monitoring server restarts (and thus chances to trigger the issue) was very low. On 10 January starting 09:30 US/Pacific, restarts for a subsequent rollout triggered the issue more frequently. By 10 January 16:45 US/Pacific, engineers had mitigated the issue by rolling back the change that triggered the issue on monitoring server restarts.\nBetween 10 January 2024, 07:23 US/Pacific and 12 January 2024, 03:08 US/Pacific querying of metric data that is older than 24 hours in us-central1 experienced significant delays leading to query failures. This also led to issues loading some Cloud Console dashboards. From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue is a failure in the pipeline responsible for data transmission from our memory component to storage component, hence creating a backlog. This issue was mitigated by resolving the failure and clearing the backlog.\nGoogle will complete a full IR in the following days that will provide a full root cause.\n**Customer Impact:**\n**Impact of Metric data unavailability:** * Customers impacted by this issue may have experienced delays and in some cases may not have seen the metric data in their monitoring dashboards. Some dashboards may have failed to load entirely. * GCP and third party products and services that consume these metrics via Cloud monitoring API would have experienced the stated issues. This includes products that rely on metrics for autoscaling. * The issue did not affect any custom metrics.\n**Impact on Metric data queries:** * Customers querying metric data that is older than 24 hours in us-central1 experienced significant delays leading to query failures.\n* This also led to issues loading some Cloud Console dashboards.\n--------------------------------------------------",

We currently do not have an ETA for the fix roll out.\nThe issue with delays in querying metric data in us-central1 that is older than 24 hours is being actively investigated for a mitigation. Our Engineering team currently understands the cause of this issue and has taken measures to limit the volume of backlog in the region.\nWe will provide an update by Thursday, 2024-01-11 12:30 US/Pacific with current details.\nDiagnosis: Customers impacted by this issue may experience delays and in some cases may not see the metric data in their monitoring dashboard. Some dashboards may fail to load entirely.\nGCP and third party products and services that consume these metrics via Cloud monitoring API may experience these above stated issues. This includes products that rely on metrics for autoscaling.\nAlerting mechanisms reliant on this metric data may experience the issue too.\nThe issue affects alerts for both Google Cloud service defined and custom metrics. The metric data for custom metrics is unaffected by the issue.\nWorkaround: Customers that are querying metric data older than 24 hours can workaround timeout failures in loading the data by querying for data that is not older than 24 hours.\nAlternatively, customers can load the metric data in their monitoring dashboards by excluding us-central1 using a location filter.\nCustomers can continue to write and query custom metric data newer than 24 hours without any issues.",

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn Wednesday, 10 January 2024, Google Cloud Monitoring and all Google Cloud Products that expose Google Cloud Monitoring experienced dashboard delays and metric query failures (Initial degradation started on 09 January 2024 8:30 am PST, due to data staleness) for a duration of 1 day, 19 hours, 45 minutes and service metric data unavailability (which started on 3 January 2024 11:23 PST with a low impact window until 10 January 2024 09:30 PST) with significant impact window starting 10 January 2024 9:30 PST for a duration of 7 hours, 15 minutes. To our Google Cloud Monitoring and Google Cloud Products customers who were affected, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nGoogle Cloud Monitoring experienced two distinct issues that impacted system metric data for most Google Cloud Products.\nMetric Data Queries:\nMetric data is stored in-memory prior to being stored on-disk. Initial degradation started on 09 January 2024 8:30 am PST, due to data staleness. A configuration change in data replication for us-central1 triggered a bottleneck in the pipeline responsible for moving data to disk for querying. Initially, this bottleneck induced backlog did not cause user-visible impact, given data continued to be served from the in-memory tier for the most recent 24h.\nWhen the pipeline blockage was mitigated 10 January 2024 8:00 am PST, the entire 20 hours backlog of files was rapidly ingested into the system that serves queries from disk. But, the resulting huge number of files triggered yet-another bottleneck in the on-disk system, causing high latency or failure for most queries.\nMetric Data Unavailability:\nA combination of two changes - one permissions-related and another scheduling-related - caused certain Cloud Metrics to be unavailable.\nThese changes were rolled out on 03 January 2024 11:23 PST. The impact from these changes was limited initially, but when mitigation was attempted on 09 January 2024 2:07 PST, it induced a bigger issue. The new problem surfaced due to a higher rate of server restarts.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nMetric Data Queries:\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the (not yet user-visible) data staleness issue by internal SLIs (Service Level Indicators) on 09 January 2024 16:58 PST and immediately started an investigation. Staleness began 09 January 2024 08:30:00 PST. When the high latency replica was removed at 10 January 2024 07:23 PST, the processing pipeline returned to normalcy.\nWhile response to this first issue was still ongoing, engineers were alerted by user-facing SLIs 10 January 2024 07:29 PST of user-visible query unavailability that had begun at 07:23 PST. They reconfigured the system to remove bottlenecks and increased the overall amount of compute resources available. This eventually reduced the backlog and returned to normalcy. All query availability/latency SLI also recovered fully at 12 January 2024 03:15 PST.\nMetric Data Unavailability:\nGoogle engineers were alerted by SLIs (Service Level Indicators) 09 January 2024 23:51 PST and immediately started an investigation.\nThe initial attempt at mitigating the problem caused wider issues. We stopped this mitigation and re-applied a newer patch that fixed the root-cause correctly. All remaining errors were resolved on 10 January 2024 16:40 PST.\nRemediation:\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n* Right-size the ingestion backlog processing that keeps up with load demand without affecting query availability.\n* Reassess and address the ingestion pipeline for bottlenecks that might induce this or related backlog issues.\n* Revisit the process for applying mitigations with better health indicators for side-effects.",

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 6 December 2023 04:20\n**Incident End:** 6 December 2023 16:47\n**Duration:** 12 hours, 27 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nGoogle App Engine\n**Regions/Zones:** asia-east1, asia-east2, asia-northeast1, asia-northeast2, asia-northeast3, asia-south1, asia-southeast1, asia-southeast2, australia-southeast1, europe-central2, europe-west1, europe-west2, europe-west3, europe-west6, northamerica-northeast1, southamerica-east1, us-central1, us-east1, us-east4, us-west1, us-west2, us-west3, us-west4\n**Description:**\nStarting on 6 December 2023 at 04:20, Google App Engine Flex experienced app unavailability issues for a duration of 12 hours and 27 minutes. This occurred due to an invalid backend service configuration update that led to L7 Load Balancer state inconsistency across regions. The issue was mitigated at 16:47 once this configuration change was rolled back.\n**Customer Impact:**\n* Google App Engine Flex deployments may have completed successfully, but the app became unavailable after some time.\n* Affected customers encountered the error message \"httpRequest.status=502 , resource.type=\"http_load_balancer\", jsonPayload.statusDetails=\"failed_to_pick_backend\"",

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 4 December 2023 19:50\n**Incident End:** 6 December 2023 03:55\n**Duration:**\n* Partial mitigation: 15 hours\n* Full mitigation: 1 day, 8 hours, 5 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nGoogle Cloud Bigtable\n**Regions/Zones:** us-central1\n**Description:**\nApproximately 0.06% of Google Cloud Bigtable dataplane requests experienced increased latency and errors in the us-central1 region. A partial mitigation was applied 15 hours from the start of the incident and the incident was fully mitigated after 1 day, 8 hours and 5 minutes. The root cause of the issue was an isolation failure in the machines that were running Cloud Bigtable servers, this manifested primarily as a low rate of network packet loss. The change that triggered the isolation issue has been identified and rolled back.\n**Customer Impact:**\nImpacted Bigtable customers experienced increased latency and low level of connection errors in the us-central1 region.\n**Additional details:**\nThe issue was first detected by automated monitoring on 4 December 2023 at 23:35 and engineers immediately started an investigation.\nAs part of the investigation, on 5 December 2023 at 14:40, engineers redirected some traffic away from a subset of the affected machines which partially mitigated impact.\nEngineers subsequently identified the trigger, and mitigated the issue on 6 December 2023 at 03:55, which fully resolved the latency. Additionally, engineers have put in place controls to prevent recurrence.",

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 4 December 2023 19:50\n**Incident End:** 6 December 2023 03:55\n**Duration:**\n* Partial mitigation: 15 hours\n* Full mitigation: 1 day, 8 hours, 5 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nGoogle Cloud Bigtable\n**Regions/Zones:** us-central1\n**Description:**\nApproximately 0.06% of Google Cloud Bigtable dataplane requests experienced increased latency and errors in the us-central1 region. A partial mitigation was applied 15 hours from the start of the incident and the incident was fully mitigated after 1 day, 8 hours and 5 minutes. The root cause of the issue was an isolation failure in the machines that were running Cloud Bigtable servers, this manifested primarily as a low rate of network packet loss. The change that triggered the isolation issue has been identified and rolled back.\n**Customer Impact:**\nImpacted Bigtable customers experienced increased latency and low level of connection errors in the us-central1 region.\n**Additional details:**\nThe issue was first detected by automated monitoring on 4 December 2023 at 23:35 and engineers immediately started an investigation.\nAs part of the investigation, on 5 December 2023 at 14:40, engineers redirected some traffic away from a subset of the affected machines which partially mitigated impact.\nEngineers subsequently identified the trigger, and mitigated the issue on 6 December 2023 at 03:55, which fully resolved the latency. Additionally, engineers have put in place controls to prevent recurrence.",

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 3 Dec 2023 16:00\n**Incident End:** 3 Dec 2023 20:22\n**Duration:** 4 hours, 22 minutes\n**Reoccurrence Start:** 3 Dec 2023 22:25\n**Recurrence End:** 4 Dec 2023 01:18\n**Recurrence Duration:** 2 hours, 53 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:** Cloud Logging\n**Regions/Zones:** Global\n**Description:**\nImpacted users were unable to load the most recent logs in Google Cloud Console UI in Log Explorer or while querying logs using API for the log entries that were ingested during the outage (historical queries still worked). From preliminary investigation, the root cause has been identified as a log processing component being in a non-functional state, which was triggered by a cluster migration stuck in a bad state.\n**Customer Impact:**\nAround 12 percent of user queries were failing globally for log entries ingested in the interval from 16:00 to 20:22 and from 22:25 to 01:18 the next day.",

If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 3 Dec 2023 16:00\n**Incident End:** 3 Dec 2023 20:22\n**Duration:** 4 hours, 22 minutes\n**Reoccurrence Start:** 3 Dec 2023 22:25\n**Recurrence End:** 4 Dec 2023 01:18\n**Recurrence Duration:** 2 hours, 53 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:** Cloud Logging\n**Regions/Zones:** Global\n**Description:**\nImpacted users were unable to load the most recent logs in Google Cloud Console UI in Log Explorer or while querying logs using API for the log entries that were ingested during the outage (historical queries still worked). From preliminary investigation, the root cause has been identified as a log processing component being in a non-functional state, which was triggered by a cluster migration stuck in a bad state.\n**Customer Impact:**\nAround 12 percent of user queries were failing globally for log entries ingested in the interval from 16:00 to 20:22 and from 22:25 to 01:18 the next day.",

This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we took immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe root cause of the issue was contention over the thread pools used by our backend metadata system.\nIn this incident, Google BigQuery received an unexpected spike of jobs that required a large number of complex requests to our backend metadata service per query. This traffic utilized the available thread pool to a high degree in the metadata servers, causing high latency for metadata requests as well as restarts in the job server. As a result, some customers in the impacted region observed high query latency and connection errors.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue at 23:27 US/Pacific on Tuesday 21 November 2023 by our monitoring tools and immediately started to take actions to mitigate the issue.\nAs a first step Google engineers increased memory on the job servers, which mitigated the issue in the interim, followed by horizontal upscaling of the job servers in the impacted region. After the third instance, Google engineers were able to narrow down the underlying root cause to the metadata server thread pools, and were able to identify the traffic pattern causing the spike of requests.\nThe issue was mitigated at 13:47 US/Pacific on Wednesday 22 November 2023, when Google engineers put in place measures to prevent these workloads from affecting the rest of the system. These measures included limits on the workload triggering the error as well as additional metadata server resources to allow them to handle increased load gracefully.\nFor our Google BigQuery customers whose backend jobs were affected, we apologize for the length and severity of this incident. We are taking immediate steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future:\n- Increasing the capacity in the metadata and job server systems.\n- Review and improve our admission control logic to ensure that appropriate limits are enforced earlier, preventing downstream servers from being overwhelmed.\n- Improve the resource governance in the thread pool system to prevent the query pattern from consuming a significant amount of resources.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nCustomers in the EU multi-region experienced elevated latencies or could not schedule jobs in Google BigQuery, on three separate instances for a cumulative period of 5 hours and 22 minutes.",

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nBeginning at 23:25 US/Pacific on Tuesday 21 November 2023 Google BigQuery’s job servers in the EU multi-region experienced elevated latency and connection errors on three separate occurrences, for a cumulative period of 5 hours and 22 minutes.\nTo our BigQuery customers whose backend jobs were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we took immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe root cause of the issue was contention over the thread pools used by our backend metadata system.\nIn this incident, Google BigQuery received an unexpected spike of jobs that required a large number of complex requests to our backend metadata service per query. This traffic utilized the available thread pool to a high degree in the metadata servers, causing high latency for metadata requests as well as restarts in the job server. As a result, some customers in the impacted region observed high query latency and connection errors.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue at 23:27 US/Pacific on Tuesday 21 November 2023 by our monitoring tools and immediately started to take actions to mitigate the issue.\nAs a first step Google engineers increased memory on the job servers, which mitigated the issue in the interim, followed by horizontal upscaling of the job servers in the impacted region. After the third instance, Google engineers were able to narrow down the underlying root cause to the metadata server thread pools, and were able to identify the traffic pattern causing the spike of requests.\nThe issue was mitigated at 13:47 US/Pacific on Wednesday 22 November 2023, when Google engineers put in place measures to prevent these workloads from affecting the rest of the system. These measures included limits on the workload triggering the error as well as additional metadata server resources to allow them to handle increased load gracefully.\nFor our Google BigQuery customers whose backend jobs were affected, we apologize for the length and severity of this incident. We are taking immediate steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future:\n- Increasing the capacity in the metadata and job server systems.\n- Review and improve our admission control logic to ensure that appropriate limits are enforced earlier, preventing downstream servers from being overwhelmed.\n- Improve the resource governance in the thread pool system to prevent the query pattern from consuming a significant amount of resources.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nCustomers in the EU multi-region experienced elevated latencies or could not schedule jobs in Google BigQuery, on three separate instances for a cumulative period of 5 hours and 22 minutes.",

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 20 November 2023 22:29\n**Incident End:** 21 November 2023 03:07\n**Duration:** 4 hours, 38 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\n* Cloud SQL\n* AlloyDB\n* Cloud Data Fusion\n* Cloud Composer\n* Cloud Backup and DR\n* Cloud Memorystore\n**Regions/Zones:** Global\n**Description:**\nMultiple Google Cloud products experienced elevated latency and error rates for a duration of 4 hours, 38 minutes in the launch of new producer service instances (like Cloud SQL, etc.) This did not impact existing instances.\nFrom preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was an unexpected load that caused a surge in API requests to Service Networking, which led to increased latency for these requests. Requests to create Service Networking from consumers to create connections, or to producer services to launch service instances, which in turn relies on Service Networking, slowed down.\nThe service networking consumer-side API experienced up to 10 times the normal levels of create connection requests, and up to 3.5 times the normal levels of add subnetwork requests. While our engineering team was working on troubleshooting the issue, the surge started decreasing at around 01:25 US/Pacific and once the requests were back to normal, the service recovered at 03:07 US/Pacific\n**Customer Impact:**\n**Cloud SQL:**\n- CREATE operations that require a subnet creation in the tenant project were slow, and took up to one hour to complete.\n**AlloyDB:**\n- Instance creations failed with timeouts due to service networking creation taking more than 10 minutes.\n**Cloud Data Fusion:**\n- Private Data Fusion instance creation failed or timed out due to Service Networking and Cloud SQL creation.\n**Cloud Composer:**\n- Environment creations fail in multiple regions due to failed Cloud SQL creations.\n**Cloud Backup and DR:**\n- ManagementServer creations failed globally for the duration of the outage. .\n**Cloud Memorystore:**\n- ServiceNetwork instance creation experienced elevated latency and failures.",

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 20 November 2023 22:29\n**Incident End:** 21 November 2023 03:07\n**Duration:** 4 hours, 38 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\n* Cloud SQL\n* AlloyDB\n* Cloud Data Fusion\n* Cloud Composer\n* Cloud Backup and DR\n* Cloud Memorystore\n**Regions/Zones:** Global\n**Description:**\nMultiple Google Cloud products experienced elevated latency and error rates for a duration of 4 hours, 38 minutes in the launch of new producer service instances (like Cloud SQL, etc.) This did not impact existing instances.\nFrom preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was an unexpected load that caused a surge in API requests to Service Networking, which led to increased latency for these requests. Requests to create Service Networking from consumers to create connections, or to producer services to launch service instances, which in turn relies on Service Networking, slowed down.\nThe service networking consumer-side API experienced up to 10 times the normal levels of create connection requests, and up to 3.5 times the normal levels of add subnetwork requests. While our engineering team was working on troubleshooting the issue, the surge started decreasing at around 01:25 US/Pacific and once the requests were back to normal, the service recovered at 03:07 US/Pacific\n**Customer Impact:**\n**Cloud SQL:**\n- CREATE operations that require a subnet creation in the tenant project were slow, and took up to one hour to complete.\n**AlloyDB:**\n- Instance creations failed with timeouts due to service networking creation taking more than 10 minutes.\n**Cloud Data Fusion:**\n- Private Data Fusion instance creation failed or timed out due to Service Networking and Cloud SQL creation.\n**Cloud Composer:**\n- Environment creations fail in multiple regions due to failed Cloud SQL creations.\n**Cloud Backup and DR:**\n- ManagementServer creations failed globally for the duration of the outage. .\n**Cloud Memorystore:**\n- ServiceNetwork instance creation experienced elevated latency and failures.",

To our BigQuery customers whose autoscaling functionality was impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe process for approving slots is managed by the backend capacity management system, which combines information about the current placement of BigQuery customers, capacities, and reservation sizes taken from an internal database in order to determine current available capacity.\nThe root cause was an issue with our capacity management service that caused an invalid data entry to be written to this database. As a result of this invalid entry, the backend capacity management system incorrectly indicated that there was no available slot capacity in the region. Because of this, customers were unable to purchase slots and autoscale reservations in the EU multi-region.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue on 21 November at 03:40 US/Pacific from customer cases. Google engineers immediately started working on mitigating the impact by restarting the process that is responsible for backend capacity distribution; however, the issue resurfaced soon afterward.\nThe incident was fully mitigated at 05:50 US/Pacific when the invalid data in the reservations database was identified and fixed.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future. In addition to fixing the issue that caused the original invalid data entry, Google is completing the following actions:\n- Increased monitoring to alert engineering teams in the event of latency encountered in autoscaling.\n- Improved our monitoring and tracking capabilities to detect problems in reservation baseline adjustment and autoscaling.\n- Improved how the backend capacity management component deals with invalid entries to reduce instances of errors or incorrect computations.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nFor a period of 9 hours and 50 minutes, starting at 20:13 US/Pacific on 20 November customers in the EU multi-region:\n- Were unable to create new reservations or upsize existing reservations.\n- Were unable to have their autoscale reservation scale up.",

        "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nBeginning on Monday, 20 November 2023, Google BigQuery experienced elevated latency and errors in the US region during three separate impact periods, for a cumulative period of 4 hours, 30 minutes.\nTo our BigQuery customers whose business was impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nBigQuery relies on Colossus [1], Google’s latest-generation distributed file system, which is used by all Google services and is capable of storing exabytes of data. BigQuery's table data is stored in files on Colossus, and BigQuery manages data in tables by replicating between multiple Colossus clusters in each region for availability and disaster resilience.\nA combination of a recent change in the interaction of BigQuery's table management logic with the Colossus metadata servers and an increase in traffic from new BigQuery workloads led to additional load on the Colossus metadata servers in a subset of clusters in the US region, causing them to throttle. This failure affected other metadata operations that are performed during queries on those tables, resulting in errors and increased latency for BigQuery workloads in the region.\n[1] https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/bigquery/bigquery-under-the-hood\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue by our internal monitoring system on Monday, 20 November 2023 at 00:33 US/Pacific, and immediately started an investigation. The issue was mitigated on 20 November at 03:12 when Google engineers moved traffic away from the impacted clusters.\nGoogle engineers were alerted to additional recurrences on Friday, 24 November at 00:00 to 00:54 and on Saturday, 25 November at 00:00 to 00:24. In both cases, engineers applied the same mitigation to the impacted clusters in order to minimize the effects on customer workloads. Based on these recurrences, Google engineers were able to further investigate the root cause of the outage and develop additional techniques for mitigating its impact. These new mitigation techniques prevented recurrences from 25 November onwards.\nGoogle is committed to preventing recurrence of this incident. We have taken the following actions:\n- Conducted a detailed investigation of the underlying cause of the incident, spanning several Google engineering teams.\n- Deployed a targeted change that will reduce the load on individual Colossus metadata servers and thus reduce throttling that was causing these failures.

This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nBigQuery relies on Colossus [1], Google’s latest-generation distributed file system, which is used by all Google services and is capable of storing exabytes of data. BigQuery's table data is stored in files on Colossus, and BigQuery manages data in tables by replicating between multiple Colossus clusters in each region for availability and disaster resilience.\nA combination of a recent change in the interaction of BigQuery's table management logic with the Colossus metadata servers and an increase in traffic from new BigQuery workloads led to additional load on the Colossus metadata servers in a subset of clusters in the US region, causing them to throttle. This failure affected other metadata operations that are performed during queries on those tables, resulting in errors and increased latency for BigQuery workloads in the region.\n[1] https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/bigquery/bigquery-under-the-hood\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue by our internal monitoring system on Monday, 20 November 2023 at 00:33 US/Pacific, and immediately started an investigation. The issue was mitigated on 20 November at 03:12 when Google engineers moved traffic away from the impacted clusters.\nGoogle engineers were alerted to additional recurrences on Friday, 24 November at 00:00 to 00:54 and on Saturday, 25 November at 00:00 to 00:24. In both cases, engineers applied the same mitigation to the impacted clusters in order to minimize the effects on customer workloads. Based on these recurrences, Google engineers were able to further investigate the root cause of the outage and develop additional techniques for mitigating its impact. These new mitigation techniques prevented recurrences from 25 November onwards.\nGoogle is committed to preventing recurrence of this incident. We have taken the following actions:\n- Conducted a detailed investigation of the underlying cause of the incident, spanning several Google engineering teams.\n- Deployed a targeted change that will reduce the load on individual Colossus metadata servers and thus reduce throttling that was causing these failures. This change has been effective in preventing failures from 25 November onwards.\n- Developing more comprehensive improvements to handling Colossus metadata load to prevent future incidents of this nature.\nAs always, Google engineers are closely monitoring the system's operation during this critical time period and are prepared to respond to any future incidents promptly. We apologize for the length and severity of this incident.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nGoogle BigQuery customers experienced elevated latency and errors in the multi-region US for a cumulative duration of 4 hours, 30 minutes.

        "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nBeginning at 10:00 US/Pacific on Monday, 13 November 2023, Cloud IAM began a cutover from one configuration management system to another. Given Google Cloud progressively and incrementally rolls out changes, a growing percentage of users experienced authentication issues in flows using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). In some circumstances, credentials signed with newer keys could not be verified during the rollout. As time progressed, new credentials were created and the impact increased, especially for flows that crossed regional boundaries.\nOn Wednesday, November 15th, starting at 12:00 PM PST, users of Firebase Authentication, Google Cloud Identity Platform (GCIP), and Firebase Security Rules in the Firestore nam5 multi-region encountered ***incorrect*** *permission denied errors* when trying to access services like Cloud Firestore and Cloud Storage for Firebase. This issue persisted for 6 hours and 41 minutes and was resolved at 18:41 PM PST on the same day.\nTo our Firebase customers who were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe identity system uses public-key cryptography for signing and verifying identity credentials (called OpenID Connect JWTs). For security reasons, the keys are rotated frequently, and new certificates are distributed to clients in every region over a period of time. The key rotation strategy is optimized both for security and reliability. There is a time interval where both keys are available for verification while the old keys are being aged out of the signing flows.\nDue to a bug in the key distribution system, the signing flows switched to using new keys before the corresponding new verification keys were distributed in all regions. Depending on client traffic patterns, some credentials signed with new keys were routed to these out-of-sync regions, causing them to be rejected. While this created an availability issue, the systems behaved appropriately by rejecting the out-of-sync keys, and at no point was security compromised.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted from support cases on 15 November and restored the services at 18:41 US/Pacific\nThe issue was mitigated by completing the rollout of new verification keys to us-central1 to reach a consistent configuration.\nWe apologize for the length and severity of this incident. We are taking the appropriate steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future. Google is also completing the following actions:\n* Review, identify, and resolve underlying configuration rollouts process issues to make sure configuration changes are consistent before being made visible to customers.\n* Enhance monitoring systems to detect any customer-impacting changes prior to customers experiencing elevated error rates (using customer perspective).\n* We are reducing the rate of changes to our Cloud authentication systems to reduce the probability of additional issues while we work to enhance our monitoring systems.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nCloud IAM:\nOther Google Cloud services using Cloud IAM service accounts may have received unexpected invalid credentials or 403 responses. Specifically, services that generate signed web tokens (for a service account) using one instance/task for Cloud IAM and validate that token using an instance/task using a different version during a rollout could be considered invalid unintentionally.\nFirestore:\nApproximately 20% of Firestore access checks were failing with invalid token errors globally. Users in the multiregion nam5 saw up to 90% of invalid token errors for Firestore Streaming APIs.\nFirebase:\nFirebase Auth/Identity Platform returned a 0.6% error rate due to this incident on the GetAccountInfo API and a 50% error rate on the low traffic CreateSessionCookie API. There was also a 2.6x increase in SignInWithCustomToken client error rate. Users might have experienced these as authentication failures (depending on application logic).\nCloud Storage for Firebase would have also experienced incorrect 403s when fetching files from buckets in us-central1.",

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support .\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 15 November 2023 12:00\n**Incident End:** 15 November 2023 18:42\n**Duration:** 6 hours, 42 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\n- Firebase Authentication\n- Google Cloud Identity Platform\n- Firebase Security Rules\n- Cloud Storage for Firebase\n- Cloud Firestore\n**Regions/Zones:** nam5 multi-region\n**Description:**\nCustomers of Firebase Authentication, Google Cloud Identity Platform (GCIP) and [Firebase Security Rules](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/security/get-started#use_the_firebase_console) in the nam5 multi-region experienced incorrect permission denied errors for a duration of 6 hours and 42 minutes while attempting to authenticate access to services including Cloud Firestore and Cloud Storage for Firebase.\nFrom preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was a mismatch between configurations. The mismatch impacted authentication services provided by Firebase Authentication and Google Cloud Identity Platform (GCIP), which allow access to downstream Firebase services. A dependency shared by both these services changed the mechanism for how security keys are rotated. A mismatch in timestamps between configurations led these services to invalidate some tokens. The issue was mitigated by accelerating the ongoing rollout to remaining clusters which resolved the timestamp mismatch.\nGoogle will complete a full IR in the following days that will provide a full root cause.\n**Customer Impact:**\n* Customers with Cloud Firestore databases residing in nam5 multi-region and using [Firebase Security Rules](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/security/get-started#use_the_firebase_console) to authenticate access for Cloud Firestore experienced permission denied errors when attempting to perform database operations via the Realtime Updates APIs.\n* Cloud Firestore customers using IAM to authenticate access were not affected by the issue.\n----------",

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nBeginning at 10:00 US/Pacific on Monday, 13 November 2023, Cloud IAM began a cutover from one configuration management system to another. Given Google Cloud progressively and incrementally rolls out changes, a growing percentage of users experienced authentication issues in flows using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). In some circumstances, credentials signed with newer keys could not be verified during the rollout. As time progressed, new credentials were created and the impact increased, especially for flows that crossed regional boundaries.\nOn Wednesday, November 15th, starting at 12:00 PM PST, users of Firebase Authentication, Google Cloud Identity Platform (GCIP), and Firebase Security Rules in the Firestore nam5 multi-region encountered ***incorrect*** *permission denied errors* when trying to access services like Cloud Firestore and Cloud Storage for Firebase. This issue persisted for 6 hours and 41 minutes and was resolved at 18:41 PM PST on the same day.\nTo our Firebase customers who were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe identity system uses public-key cryptography for signing and verifying identity credentials (called OpenID Connect JWTs). For security reasons, the keys are rotated frequently, and new certificates are distributed to clients in every region over a period of time. The key rotation strategy is optimized both for security and reliability. There is a time interval where both keys are available for verification while the old keys are being aged out of the signing flows.\nDue to a bug in the key distribution system, the signing flows switched to using new keys before the corresponding new verification keys were distributed in all regions. Depending on client traffic patterns, some credentials signed with new keys were routed to these out-of-sync regions, causing them to be rejected. While this created an availability issue, the systems behaved appropriately by rejecting the out-of-sync keys, and at no point was security compromised.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted from support cases on 15 November and restored the services at 18:41 US/Pacific\nThe issue was mitigated by completing the rollout of new verification keys to us-central1 to reach a consistent configuration.\nWe apologize for the length and severity of this incident. We are taking the appropriate steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future. Google is also completing the following actions:\n* Review, identify, and resolve underlying configuration rollouts process issues to make sure configuration changes are consistent before being made visible to customers.\n* Enhance monitoring systems to detect any customer-impacting changes prior to customers experiencing elevated error rates (using customer perspective).\n* We are reducing the rate of changes to our Cloud authentication systems to reduce the probability of additional issues while we work to enhance our monitoring systems.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nCloud IAM:\nOther Google Cloud services using Cloud IAM service accounts may have received unexpected invalid credentials or 403 responses. Specifically, services that generate signed web tokens (for a service account) using one instance/task for Cloud IAM and validate that token using an instance/task using a different version during a rollout could be considered invalid unintentionally.\nFirestore:\nApproximately 20% of Firestore access checks were failing with invalid token errors globally. Users in the multiregion nam5 saw up to 90% of invalid token errors for Firestore Streaming APIs.\nFirebase:\nFirebase Auth/Identity Platform returned a 0.6% error rate due to this incident on the GetAccountInfo API and a 50% error rate on the low traffic CreateSessionCookie API. There was also a 2.6x increase in SignInWithCustomToken client error rate. Users might have experienced these as authentication failures (depending on application logic).\nCloud Storage for Firebase would have also experienced incorrect 403s when fetching files from buckets in us-central1.",

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support or to Google Workspace Support using help article https://support.google.com/a/answer/1047213.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 8 November, 2023 07:59\n**Incident End:** 8 November, 2023 08:07\n**Duration:** 8 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nMultiple Google Cloud Products Including Google Cloud Storage (GCS)\n**Regions/Zones:** After further analysis, it was confirmed that impact was limited to europe-west4 and europe-north1.\n**Description:**\nMultiple Google Cloud products experienced elevated error rates and packet loss for inter-regional traffic towards and from europe-west4 and europe-north1 for a duration of 8 minutes. The only exception to this was for Google Cloud Storage (GCS), which was impacted for a duration of 72 minutes with partial recovery after approximately 31 minutes.\nFrom preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was a significant transatlantic fiber cut that was detected by internal monitoring and triggered re-routing of both routed and tunneled traffic to alternate links. Some services were affected by a link capacity shortage after the event and until additional link capacity was made available.\n**Customer Impact:**\nCustomers may have experienced elevated error rates and packet loss for inter-regional traffic to the affected European regions.\nFor Google Cloud Storage (GCS)\nCustomers may have experienced 500 errors for GCS resources in the affected regions.\nGCS impact was partially mitigated at approximately 08:30 US/Pacific with full recovery by 09:10 US/Pacific, as capacity recovered.",

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support or to Google Workspace Support using help article https://support.google.com/a/answer/1047213.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 8 November, 2023 07:59\n**Incident End:** 8 November, 2023 08:07\n**Duration:** 8 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nMultiple Google Cloud Products Including Google Cloud Storage (GCS)\n**Regions/Zones:** After further analysis, it was confirmed that impact was limited to europe-west4 and europe-north1.\n**Description:**\nMultiple Google Cloud products experienced elevated error rates and packet loss for inter-regional traffic towards and from europe-west4 and europe-north1 for a duration of 8 minutes. The only exception to this was for Google Cloud Storage (GCS), which was impacted for a duration of 72 minutes with partial recovery after approximately 31 minutes.\nFrom preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was a significant transatlantic fiber cut that was detected by internal monitoring and triggered re-routing of both routed and tunneled traffic to alternate links. Some services were affected by a link capacity shortage after the event and until additional link capacity was made available.\n**Customer Impact:**\nCustomers may have experienced elevated error rates and packet loss for inter-regional traffic to the affected European regions.\nFor Google Cloud Storage (GCS)\nCustomers may have experienced 500 errors for GCS resources in the affected regions.\nGCS impact was partially mitigated at approximately 08:30 US/Pacific with full recovery by 09:10 US/Pacific, as capacity recovered.",

If the value is a version between 0.4.272 and 0.4.280 (inclusive), then the cluster is currently affected.\nWe will provide more information by Monday, 2023-11-06 14:00 US/Pacific.\nDiagnosis: * Impact is limited to gke-metadata-server versions 0.4.272 to 0.4.280\n* gke-metadata-server and customer applications that depend on it should continue to work.\n* gke-metadata-server may be exhausting their Cloud Logging quota.\nWorkaround:\n* Customers using GKE Rapid Channel can upgrade their cluster control plane to 1.28.2-gke.1157000 or above.\n* Customers on GKE Regular Channel, GKE Stable Channel, or who are not using release channels do not have a workaround at this time.",

From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was the loss of multiple Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) peer circuits for the affected data center.\n**Customer Impact:**\n* Affected customers may have experienced connectivity issues for stretched clusters in the affected region.\n* Hosts in vCenter may have been disconnected.\n* Additionally, some customers may have experienced connectivity issues from their GCP and on-premises networks to their Private Clouds for the duration of the outage.\n**Additional details:**\nGoogle engineers brought up a backup transit link on the remaining circuit at 18:03 US/Pacific, which restored connectivity between stretch sites. Engineers then began migrating customer connections to the remaining circuit to restore access from on-premises sites. All Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) peer circuits were restored by 20:58 US/Pacific.\nSome customers may have experienced residual impact beyond the resolution time due to the duration of time that their stretch sites were unreachable.",

        "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn Monday, 16 October 2023, Google BigQuery’s load job API started rejecting load jobs with the error message: [INVALID_INPUT] message=Column Name Character Map is not supported for this format. errorProto=code: \"INVALID_VALUE\"\nargument: \"Column Name Character Map is not supported for this format.\nThe issue lasted five hours. To our BigQuery customers whose business analytics were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe issue originated from a recent rollout to support more features for flexible column name[1] (currently in Preview), in order to support a richer set of additional characters in the column name. Once the feature reaches General Availability (GA), these characters will be able to have full support across various BigQuery features, including column schema in load.\nA subset of these new characters have historically been handled by normalization and were converted to underscore(_) during load when generating table column schema. In order to maintain backwards compatibility for a set of customers, while allowing all customers to have the flexibility to use the richer set of additional characters as is during load, this rollout is intended as one of the steps to: 1. Enable additional user control to choose between the previous and new behavior for load with such characters in column names. 2. Set normalization as the default for a group of customers that historically have been using this behavior in production, as a backward compatibility support.\nDue to an incomplete configuration during the rollout, BigQuery load APIs were not enabled to handle the introduced normalization setting as the default. This led to errors from load API for all formats for a group of customers who were configured with the backward compatibility support.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the load job failures via a support case on 16 October 2023 16:24 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Google engineers quickly identified the root cause was an ongoing configuration rollout. They first halted the ongoing configuration rollout and limited the impact to three regions (US multi-region, asia-southeast1, azure-eastus2). At 16:56 US/Pacific, rollback for the configuration in the impacted region started, finishing at 19:00 US/Pacific.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n* Immediately start the work to fix the code issues which led to misconfiguration during the rollout.\n* Add additional monitoring and alerting to detect and resolve such issues faster in future.\n* Review and improve gradual roll out policy for configuration changes.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Monday 16 October, 2023 from 14:00 to 19:00 US/Pacific, BigQuery experienced load job errors in three regions (US multi-region, asia-southeast1, azure-eastus2). Google BigQuery’s load job api started rejecting load jobs with the error message: [INVALID_INPUT] message=Column Name Character Map is not supported for this format. errorProto=code: \"INVALID_VALUE\"\nargument: \"Column Name Character Map is not supported for this format.\nFor affected customers, 100 percent of their load jobs failed during the incident window. The Load Data SQL statement[2] was not affected.\n[1] https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/schemas#flexible-column-names\n[2] https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/other-statements#load_data_statement",

To our BigQuery customers whose business analytics were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe issue originated from a recent rollout to support more features for flexible column name[1] (currently in Preview), in order to support a richer set of additional characters in the column name. Once the feature reaches General Availability (GA), these characters will be able to have full support across various BigQuery features, including column schema in load.\nA subset of these new characters have historically been handled by normalization and were converted to underscore(_) during load when generating table column schema. In order to maintain backwards compatibility for a set of customers, while allowing all customers to have the flexibility to use the richer set of additional characters as is during load, this rollout is intended as one of the steps to: 1. Enable additional user control to choose between the previous and new behavior for load with such characters in column names. 2. Set normalization as the default for a group of customers that historically have been using this behavior in production, as a backward compatibility support.\nDue to an incomplete configuration during the rollout, BigQuery load APIs were not enabled to handle the introduced normalization setting as the default. This led to errors from load API for all formats for a group of customers who were configured with the backward compatibility support.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the load job failures via a support case on 16 October 2023 16:24 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Google engineers quickly identified the root cause was an ongoing configuration rollout. They first halted the ongoing configuration rollout and limited the impact to three regions (US multi-region, asia-southeast1, azure-eastus2). At 16:56 US/Pacific, rollback for the configuration in the impacted region started, finishing at 19:00 US/Pacific.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n* Immediately start the work to fix the code issues which led to misconfiguration during the rollout.\n* Add additional monitoring and alerting to detect and resolve such issues faster in future.\n* Review and improve gradual roll out policy for configuration changes.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Monday 16 October, 2023 from 14:00 to 19:00 US/Pacific, BigQuery experienced load job errors in three regions (US multi-region, asia-southeast1, azure-eastus2). Google BigQuery’s load job api started rejecting load jobs with the error message: [INVALID_INPUT] message=Column Name Character Map is not supported for this format. errorProto=code: \"INVALID_VALUE\"\nargument: \"Column Name Character Map is not supported for this format.\nFor affected customers, 100 percent of their load jobs failed during the incident window. The Load Data SQL statement[2] was not affected.\n[1] https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/schemas#flexible-column-names\n[2] https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/other-statements#load_data_statement",

        "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn 5 October, multiple Google Cloud products experienced networking connectivity issues which impacted new and migrated VMs in the us-central1 region for a duration of 7 hours, 47 minutes. Existing VMs were not directly affected. We sincerely apologize for the impact caused to your business. We have identified the root cause and are taking immediate steps to prevent future failures.\n## Root Cause\nThe root cause of the issues was a management plane behavior change that had been rolling out slowly across Google Cloud. The aim of the change was to provide better decoupling in processing API updates to GCP Instance Groups and Network Endpoint Groups used as load balancer backends, thus providing better reliability and performance.\nThis change had been rolled out to several regions without incident. However, when it was deployed in us-central1, large workload sizes in the region triggered an unexpected memory increase for the control plane for virtual network routers. The controllers eventually ran out of memory, and although they were automatically restarted, the large workload size meant that they repeated the out-of-memory and restart sequence.\nVirtual routers and their controllers are deployed into separate zonal failure domains. However, as the management plane change affected a regional API, this extended the issue to all virtual routers in the region, causing synchronized memory pressure and unavailability of controllers.\nThis unavailability of controllers prevented the virtual network routers from being updated with fresh state, such as new VMs, new locations of migrated VMs, dynamic routes, and health state of load balancer backends. As the frequency of out-of-memory events increased, delays in updating router state increased until there was no practical progress being made.\nExisting VMs that did not migrate and did not change their health state were not affected directly. However, traffic to or from these VMs may have passed through a separate affected device such as a VPN Gateway, internal load balancer, or other VM.\nThere are separate sets of virtual routers for intra-region and cross-region traffic, each with their own control plane component. The cross-region routers were affected first and for a longer duration than the intra-region routers.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to slowness in the virtual network control plane in us-central1 on 04 October at 21:45 US/Pacific and immediately started investigations. Initial investigations revealed that slowness was intermittent. At 02:11 US/Pacific on 05 October alerts were received for failures in the virtual network router controllers due to memory exhaustion. Engineers immediately began an attempt to mitigate by allocating more memory. At 03:08 US/Pacific, our networking telemetry began to indicate cross-region packet loss to or from us-central1.\nBy 05:27 US/Pacific, the memory allocation change started to reach production. At 07:00 US/Pacific, the telemetry indicated intra-region packet loss primarily to and from us-central1-c, but it then subsided at 08:15 US/Pacific due to the rollout of the increased memory allocation.\nAt 08:22 US/Pacific, the increased memory usage was correlated with the rollout of the management plane change. At 08:52 US/Pacific, a rollback of the management plane change was started, completing in us-central1 at 09:35 US/Pacific. At this point all out of memory events had stopped.\nWhile impact had been greatly reduced, a small number of routers were not accepting updates and had to be manually restarted. These restarts did not cause any additional packet loss. By 10:55 US/Pacific all packet loss had stopped and the control plane was processing updates normally.\nIf your service or application was affected, we apologize — this is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you. Google is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n- Proactive alerting of memory risks and unexpected increases.\n- Refactoring our deployment configuration to allow engineers to reallocate memory much more quickly.\n- Re-evaluating existing and establishing new practices and safety mechanisms for API reconciliation.\n- Increasing visibility of management plane changes across teams so that they can be correlated more quickly.\n- Adjusting our deployment footprint to reduce the chance of simultaneous regional memory exhaustion due to regional API changes.\n- Memory optimizations in the traffic routers and their controllers to prevent unnecessary overhead.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn 5 October 2023 from 03:08 to 10:55 US/Pacific, multiple Google cloud products experienced networking connectivity issues in us-central1. Newly created and recently migrated VMs experienced extended delays before networking became functional. This impacted higher level workloads that rely on provisioning VMs.\n**Virtual Private Cloud:**\n- Newly created VMs for some projects in us-central1 experienced extended delays before networking became funcitonal.\n- Live migrated VMs for some projects in us-central1 experienced extended loss of connectivity after migrating.\n- Health check state of VMs in some projects in us-central1 were not being propagated to load balancers in a timely manner.\n- From 3:08 to 10:55, impact was largely limited to cross-regional virtual network traffic. From 7:00 to 8:15, there was a substantial impact on intra-region flows.\n**Google Kubernetes Engine:**\n- Up to 0.4 percent of clusters in us-central1 may have experienced downtime and/or delays during the cluster operations such as recreate and upgrade.\n- 24 percent of cluster creation attempts experienced failure or delay. For the majority, no action was needed with the operations succeeding after a period of up to 120 minutes.\n- Note that affected operations may have been triggered automatically by Google, e.g. autoupgrade or node repair, as well as by customers.\n- During the downtime, in the Google Cloud Console Clusters page, customers may have seen that some Nodes had not registered and the cluster was unhealthy.\n**Cloud Data Fusion:**\n- New Cloud Data Fusion VM creation may have failed in the us-central1 region. This issue impacted existing instance operations in the us-central1 region.\n- Around 27 percent of the total Data Fusion requests in us-central1 at the time encountered issues.\n**Cloud Filestore:**\n- New Filestore VMs created during upgrades, were unable to communicate with each other. Filestore upgrades may have failed and were rolled back to the previous version.\n- Before the incident started, only ~6 percent of instances in us-central1-a had been updated. This issue prevented the update of the rest.\n- Update backlogs processed gradually and eventually completed ~1 day later on 06 October.\n**Cloud SQL:**\n- New Cloud SQL VM creations failed and Cloud SQL databases were unavailable if changes that resulted in a new VM being created were made to the existing instances. (e.g. Update, Self Service Maintenance, Clone/Failover, etc.)\n**Cloud Dataproc:**\n- New cluster creations experienced elevated latencies and failures: up to 5 percent of new cluster creations failed in us-central1\n- Existing clusters may have failed to execute jobs.\n**Cloud Dataflow:**\n- Existing jobs experienced degradation in acquiring resources in response to demand (horizontal scaling failures).\n- New jobs faced start up failure or extended initialization latencies.\n- Container downloads from Artifact Registry failed (resulting in failure to instantiate or horizontally scale workloads).\n- The issue impacted less than 5 percent of all Dataflow jobs.\n**Cloud Datastream:**\n- On 5 October from 08:00 to 10:10 US/Pacific, streams in the us-central1 region experienced delayed ingestion of data due to a high restart rate of the stream’s pods which were in charge of scheduling the ingestion tasks.\n- Less than 5 percent of streams in us-central-1 were impacted.\n- The impacted streams had a spike in the “Data freshness” and “Total latency” monitoring metrics in this timeframe.\n-----------",

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support .\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 5 October 2023 03:00\n**Incident End:** 5 October 2023 11:00\n**Duration:** 8 hours\n**Affected Services and Features:**\n- Virtual Private Cloud\n- Google Kubernetes Engine\n- Google Compute Engine\n- Google Cloud Dataproc\n- Google Cloud Dataflow\n- Cloud Data Fusion\n- Cloud Filestore\n- Cloud SQL\n- Batch\n**Regions/Zones:** us-central1\n**Description:**\nMultiple Google Cloud products experienced networking connectivity issues which impacted VMs in the us-central1 region for a duration of 8 hours. From preliminary analysis, the issue was due to a recent rollout of the management plane which caused the control plane for some traffic routers to run out of memory. This caused the routing policy in the data plane to become stale.\nThe issue was mitigated by rolling back the management plane change that triggered the issue. The memory allocation for the affected control plane component was increased to prevent recurrence of the issue.\nGoogle will complete a full Incident Report in the following days that will provide a detailed root cause.\n**Customer Impact:**\n**Virtual Private Cloud:**\n- Newly created VMs for some projects in us-central1 experienced extended delays before networking became funcitonal.\n- Live migrated VMs for some projects in us-central1 experienced extended loss of connectivity after migrating.\n- Health check state of VMs in some projects in us-central1 were not being propagated to load balancers in a timely manner.\n- Cross-region traffic originating from or destined to us-central1 was more likely to be affected than intra-region traffic.\n**Google Kubernetes Engine:**\n- Clusters may have experienced downtime after recreate, upgrades, and creations. No action was needed as they eventually fixed themselves within 30 to 120 minutes. The downtime was triggered by recreates etc, once a recreate etc has been initiated. During the downtime, customers might see in the Google Cloud Console Clusters page that some Nodes have not registered and the cluster is unhealthy.\n**Cloud Data Fusion:**\n- New Cloud Data Fusion VM creation may have failed in the us-central1 region. This issue impacted existing instance operations in the us-central1 region.\n**Cloud Filestore:**\n- New Filestore VMs created during upgrades, were unable to communicate with each other. Filestore upgrades may have failed and were rolled back to the previous version.\n**Cloud SQL:**\n- New Cloud SQL VM creations failed and Cloud SQL databases were unavailable if changes that resulted in a new VM being created were made to the existing instances. (e.g. Update, SSM, Drain, Clone/Failover, etc.)\n**Cloud Dataproc:**\n- New cluster creations experienced elevated latencies and failures.\n- Existing clusters may have failed to execute jobs.\n**Cloud Dataflow:**\n- Existing jobs experienced degradation in acquiring resources in response to demand (horizontal scaling failures).\n- New jobs faced start up failure or extended initialization latencies.\n- Container downloads from Artifact Registry failed (resulting in failure to instantiate or horizontally scale workloads).\nAny products or services reliant on VM creation may have observed impact for the duration of the incident. We are continuing to investigate and will provide further detail on additional impact in the full Incident Report.\n--------------------",

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn 5 October, multiple Google Cloud products experienced networking connectivity issues which impacted new and migrated VMs in the us-central1 region for a duration of 7 hours, 47 minutes. Existing VMs were not directly affected. We sincerely apologize for the impact caused to your business. We have identified the root cause and are taking immediate steps to prevent future failures.\n## Root Cause\nThe root cause of the issues was a management plane behavior change that had been rolling out slowly across Google Cloud. The aim of the change was to provide better decoupling in processing API updates to GCP Instance Groups and Network Endpoint Groups used as load balancer backends, thus providing better reliability and performance.\nThis change had been rolled out to several regions without incident. However, when it was deployed in us-central1, large workload sizes in the region triggered an unexpected memory increase for the control plane for virtual network routers. The controllers eventually ran out of memory, and although they were automatically restarted, the large workload size meant that they repeated the out-of-memory and restart sequence.\nVirtual routers and their controllers are deployed into separate zonal failure domains. However, as the management plane change affected a regional API, this extended the issue to all virtual routers in the region, causing synchronized memory pressure and unavailability of controllers.\nThis unavailability of controllers prevented the virtual network routers from being updated with fresh state, such as new VMs, new locations of migrated VMs, dynamic routes, and health state of load balancer backends. As the frequency of out-of-memory events increased, delays in updating router state increased until there was no practical progress being made.\nExisting VMs that did not migrate and did not change their health state were not affected directly. However, traffic to or from these VMs may have passed through a separate affected device such as a VPN Gateway, internal load balancer, or other VM.\nThere are separate sets of virtual routers for intra-region and cross-region traffic, each with their own control plane component. The cross-region routers were affected first and for a longer duration than the intra-region routers.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to slowness in the virtual network control plane in us-central1 on 04 October at 21:45 US/Pacific and immediately started investigations. Initial investigations revealed that slowness was intermittent. At 02:11 US/Pacific on 05 October alerts were received for failures in the virtual network router controllers due to memory exhaustion. Engineers immediately began an attempt to mitigate by allocating more memory. At 03:08 US/Pacific, our networking telemetry began to indicate cross-region packet loss to or from us-central1.\nBy 05:27 US/Pacific, the memory allocation change started to reach production. At 07:00 US/Pacific, the telemetry indicated intra-region packet loss primarily to and from us-central1-c, but it then subsided at 08:15 US/Pacific due to the rollout of the increased memory allocation.\nAt 08:22 US/Pacific, the increased memory usage was correlated with the rollout of the management plane change. At 08:52 US/Pacific, a rollback of the management plane change was started, completing in us-central1 at 09:35 US/Pacific. At this point all out of memory events had stopped.\nWhile impact had been greatly reduced, a small number of routers were not accepting updates and had to be manually restarted. These restarts did not cause any additional packet loss. By 10:55 US/Pacific all packet loss had stopped and the control plane was processing updates normally.\nIf your service or application was affected, we apologize — this is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you. Google is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n- Proactive alerting of memory risks and unexpected increases.\n- Refactoring our deployment configuration to allow engineers to reallocate memory much more quickly.\n- Re-evaluating existing and establishing new practices and safety mechanisms for API reconciliation.\n- Increasing visibility of management plane changes across teams so that they can be correlated more quickly.\n- Adjusting our deployment footprint to reduce the chance of simultaneous regional memory exhaustion due to regional API changes.\n- Memory optimizations in the traffic routers and their controllers to prevent unnecessary overhead.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn 5 October 2023 from 03:08 to 10:55 US/Pacific, multiple Google cloud products experienced networking connectivity issues in us-central1. Newly created and recently migrated VMs experienced extended delays before networking became functional. This impacted higher level workloads that rely on provisioning VMs.\n**Virtual Private Cloud:**\n- Newly created VMs for some projects in us-central1 experienced extended delays before networking became funcitonal.\n- Live migrated VMs for some projects in us-central1 experienced extended loss of connectivity after migrating.\n- Health check state of VMs in some projects in us-central1 were not being propagated to load balancers in a timely manner.\n- From 3:08 to 10:55, impact was largely limited to cross-regional virtual network traffic. From 7:00 to 8:15, there was a substantial impact on intra-region flows.\n**Google Kubernetes Engine:**\n- Up to 0.4 percent of clusters in us-central1 may have experienced downtime and/or delays during the cluster operations such as recreate and upgrade.\n- 24 percent of cluster creation attempts experienced failure or delay. For the majority, no action was needed with the operations succeeding after a period of up to 120 minutes.\n- Note that affected operations may have been triggered automatically by Google, e.g. autoupgrade or node repair, as well as by customers.\n- During the downtime, in the Google Cloud Console Clusters page, customers may have seen that some Nodes had not registered and the cluster was unhealthy.\n**Cloud Data Fusion:**\n- New Cloud Data Fusion VM creation may have failed in the us-central1 region. This issue impacted existing instance operations in the us-central1 region.\n- Around 27 percent of the total Data Fusion requests in us-central1 at the time encountered issues.\n**Cloud Filestore:**\n- New Filestore VMs created during upgrades, were unable to communicate with each other. Filestore upgrades may have failed and were rolled back to the previous version.\n- Before the incident started, only ~6 percent of instances in us-central1-a had been updated. This issue prevented the update of the rest.\n- Update backlogs processed gradually and eventually completed ~1 day later on 06 October.\n**Cloud SQL:**\n- New Cloud SQL VM creations failed and Cloud SQL databases were unavailable if changes that resulted in a new VM being created were made to the existing instances. (e.g. Update, Self Service Maintenance, Clone/Failover, etc.)\n**Cloud Dataproc:**\n- New cluster creations experienced elevated latencies and failures: up to 5 percent of new cluster creations failed in us-central1\n- Existing clusters may have failed to execute jobs.\n**Cloud Dataflow:**\n- Existing jobs experienced degradation in acquiring resources in response to demand (horizontal scaling failures).\n- New jobs faced start up failure or extended initialization latencies.\n- Container downloads from Artifact Registry failed (resulting in failure to instantiate or horizontally scale workloads).\n- The issue impacted less than 5 percent of all Dataflow jobs.\n**Cloud Datastream:**\n- On 5 October from 08:00 to 10:10 US/Pacific, streams in the us-central1 region experienced delayed ingestion of data due to a high restart rate of the stream’s pods which were in charge of scheduling the ingestion tasks.\n- Less than 5 percent of streams in us-central-1 were impacted.\n- The impacted streams had a spike in the “Data freshness” and “Total latency” monitoring metrics in this timeframe.\n-----------",

        "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn Monday, 2 October 2023, Dialogflow - Essentials (ES) and Customer Experience (CX), Cloud Speech-to-Text v1 API, Contact Center AI Insights - Analysis and Summarization, Cloud Billing Support, Workspace Support experienced elevated error rates and service unavailability for two hours. To our customers whose business was impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nDialogflow is used to analyze both text and audio inputs from customers. For audio inputs, Dialogflow has a critical dependency on Cloud Speech-to-Text service as this service transcribes audio to text.\nA configuration issue caused our systems to think that a Cloud STT’s dependency was down and thus could not serve traffic. This propagated through multiple systems with dependencies on each other. The system that was down was not in fact needed to serve requests, but the configuration caused traffic to be deflected anyway.\nThis occurred because that unused dependency was scheduled for turndown on 2 October 2023. When this service was turned down globally instead of staged rollout, it triggered the configuration dependency and caused the outage.\nIt was a case of follow-on impact: Internal speech serving service > Cloud Speech-to-Text > Dialogflow > Billing Support / Workspace Support.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were paged by automated alert 2 October at 12:32 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Once the nature and scope of the issue became clear, they quickly rolled out a change to unblock customers. The issue was mitigated by marking Dialogflow’s dependency on Cloud Speech as optional, as well as marking Cloud Speech’s internal dependency as optional, allowing both services to recover.\nGoogle is committed preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and are taking the following actions:\n* Enhance the turndown process to remove dependencies on redundant systems.\n* Augment testing of configuration changes prior to deployment in customer environments.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Monday 2 October from 12:30 to 14:30 US/Pacific, Dialogflow ES, Dialogflow CX, Cloud Speech-to-Text, Contact Center AI Insights, Google Cloud Billing support, and Workspace support experienced elevated error rates and service unavailability for two hours.\nDialogflow ES and CX: * Customers experienced UNAVAILABLE errors and service unavailability across all regions. 100% of Dialogflow traffic was affected for the duration of the incident.\nCloud Speech-to-Text v1 API:\n* Customers experienced UNAVAILABLE errors and service unavailability across all regions. 100% of Speech-to-Text v1 API traffic was affected for the duration of the incident. Speech-to-Text v2 API was not affected.\nContact Center AI Insights\n* Contact Center AI insights analysis experienced significant elevated latencies causing requests to fail. 90%+ traffic was affected. The affected features include summarization, create analysis, delete analysis, and bulk analysis.\nCloud Billing Support:\n* Customers were unable to get billing help through the “billing assistant” for the duration of the issue. 100% of customers who tried would have received an error and prevented them from receiving any support.\nWorkspace Support:\n* Workspace customers were unable to create cases from admin.google.com. Other support channels like support.cloud.google.com were unaffected by the issue. One hundred percent of customers who tried would have received an error that prevented them from receiving any support.",

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn Monday, 2 October 2023, Dialogflow - Essentials (ES) and Customer Experience (CX), Cloud Speech-to-Text v1 API, Contact Center AI Insights - Analysis and Summarization, Cloud Billing Support, Workspace Support experienced elevated error rates and service unavailability for two hours. To our customers whose business was impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nDialogflow is used to analyze both text and audio inputs from customers. For audio inputs, Dialogflow has a critical dependency on Cloud Speech-to-Text service as this service transcribes audio to text.\nA configuration issue caused our systems to think that a Cloud STT’s dependency was down and thus could not serve traffic. This propagated through multiple systems with dependencies on each other. The system that was down was not in fact needed to serve requests, but the configuration caused traffic to be deflected anyway.\nThis occurred because that unused dependency was scheduled for turndown on 2 October 2023. When this service was turned down globally instead of staged rollout, it triggered the configuration dependency and caused the outage.\nIt was a case of follow-on impact: Internal speech serving service > Cloud Speech-to-Text > Dialogflow > Billing Support / Workspace Support.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were paged by automated alert 2 October at 12:32 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Once the nature and scope of the issue became clear, they quickly rolled out a change to unblock customers. The issue was mitigated by marking Dialogflow’s dependency on Cloud Speech as optional, as well as marking Cloud Speech’s internal dependency as optional, allowing both services to recover.\nGoogle is committed preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and are taking the following actions:\n* Enhance the turndown process to remove dependencies on redundant systems.\n* Augment testing of configuration changes prior to deployment in customer environments.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Monday 2 October from 12:30 to 14:30 US/Pacific, Dialogflow ES, Dialogflow CX, Cloud Speech-to-Text, Contact Center AI Insights, Google Cloud Billing support, and Workspace support experienced elevated error rates and service unavailability for two hours.\nDialogflow ES and CX: * Customers experienced UNAVAILABLE errors and service unavailability across all regions. 100% of Dialogflow traffic was affected for the duration of the incident.\nCloud Speech-to-Text v1 API:\n* Customers experienced UNAVAILABLE errors and service unavailability across all regions. 100% of Speech-to-Text v1 API traffic was affected for the duration of the incident. Speech-to-Text v2 API was not affected.\nContact Center AI Insights\n* Contact Center AI insights analysis experienced significant elevated latencies causing requests to fail. 90%+ traffic was affected. The affected features include summarization, create analysis, delete analysis, and bulk analysis.\nCloud Billing Support:\n* Customers were unable to get billing help through the “billing assistant” for the duration of the issue. 100% of customers who tried would have received an error and prevented them from receiving any support.\nWorkspace Support:\n* Workspace customers were unable to create cases from admin.google.com. Other support channels like support.cloud.google.com were unaffected by the issue. One hundred percent of customers who tried would have received an error that prevented them from receiving any support.",

The Reservation server performs permission and quota checks and sends a request to the Capacity Manager server to approve capacity. In order to calculate available capacity in the region, Capacity Manager maintains a list that maps users to different data centers within the region. This information is continuously synchronized to a backend database.\nOn 27 September 2023, an issue with the size of the data written to the database resulted in errors for some transactions. By 28 September 2023, at 06:00 US/Pacific, the transactions began to fail consistently, causing the Capacity Management system to enter a crash loop and preventing calculation of available capacity in the region and causing failures in slot purchase approval.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue by internal monitoring on 28 September 2023 at 06:48 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Engineers initially determined that the start of the issue aligned with a recent release and initiated a rollback at 10:13 US/Pacific.\nAt 10:42 US/Pacific, testing showed that the rollback had not mitigated the issue. Due to the nature and scope of the issue, engineers began manually approving slot requests. At 11:50 US/Pacific, engineers implemented auto-approval for all slot requests in the US multi-region as a temporary mitigation while the root cause was investigated further.\nEngineers were able to fully mitigate the issue at 17:12 US/Pacific by reducing the size of the database transaction. Once the mitigation was confirmed, engineers rolled back the temporary auto-approval change.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n* Short term, we are enhancing the retry logic for project assignment mappings when errors are detected in the BigQuery capacity mapping system.\n* Short term, we are working to optimize the reservation database to reduce contention and reduce runtime dependencies on it.\n* In the medium-term, we are working to decouple reservation processing from the capacity mapping system to make capacity allocation independent of reservation mapping.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn 28 September 2023, from 06:00 to 17:12 US/Pacific, Google BigQuery users in the US multi-region were unable to purchase additional slots through autoscaling or new capacity commitments. Additionally, reservation assignment propagation would have been delayed.\n* [1] https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/slots-autoscaling-intro\n* [2] https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reservations-details\n* [3] https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reservations-assignments\n* [4] https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/reservations/rpc",

Full mitigation was applied at 17:12. This resolved the reservation assignment updates propagation delays.\n**Customer Impact:**\n- BigQuery users in US multi-region were unable to scale up slots, purchase new capacity commitments.\n- Users also had propagation delays in reservation assignment updates.\n-------------------",

        "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn Thursday, 21 September 2023, Cloud Load Balancing experienced a configuration propagation issue resulting in a failure to serve traffic for some customers. To our Cloud Load Balancing customers whose businesses were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe root cause of the issue was a change in the leader election process of a component of Google Cloud Load Balancer’s configuration management pipeline. This change triggered a race condition in a downstream component in the pipeline, resulting in overwriting some customer configurations with empty configurations.\nThis change of leader election was being done as part of a roll out to increase the resiliency of the system. Google engineers rolled out the change gradually and made use of a canary process to gate progress on correct functionality; however our automated rollout verification did not detect this issue, as in isolation the component rolling out was performing correctly. While the roll out was in progress, the issue was detected by our dataplane monitoring due to the increased rate of 4xx errors being served.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to an issue on 22 September 2023 at 04:51 US/Pacific from dataplane monitoring for HTTP 4xx responses and froze the configuration pipeline to avoid further impact.\nAt 05:15 US/pacific, Google engineers reinstated a snapshot of known good config for the impacted config type, mitigating the dataplane errors for which we had been alerted. At 07:15 US/Pacific the configuration pipeline was un-frozen, following our standard process. However our validations identified an underlying issue that was still present and that impact to the data plane resurfaced after the configuration pipeline was unfrozen.\nBetween 07:15 and 12:40 Google engineers focused on root cause investigation and continuous manual mitigation of impacted project configurations, which were being affected due to natural leader election flips. During this time we identified the root cause component but due to the nature of the issue, were unable to follow our standard rollback procedure resulting in a delay until 16:58, when Google engineers started a custom rollback of the relevant management plane component, which was completed at 23:34.\nOnce this rollback was completed, Google engineers performed additional validations by triggering leader election changes and ensuring that these changes no longer caused the unintended behavior.\nAffected customers were recommended to try making changes to the configuration of their External Application Load Balancer. This resolved URL loading failure issues for impacted customers.\nWe apologize for the length and severity of this incident. We are taking multiple steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future.\n- Identify and resolve the underlying race condition in our configuration lifecycle that resulted in the unintended modifications.\n- Improve tooling and processes to more quickly and safely rollback components in the configuration management system.\n- Improve Google's internal monitoring and visualization to better assess and understand source of 4XX response alerting to expedite detection.\n- The Configuration Management System used by Global Load Balancer is scoped to operate at a project level within the global scope today. This architecture was a key reason for customers experiencing global impact. We had already initiated a program to make these operations happen at a regional level, in every region as part of our ongoing reliability improvement roadmap. This would reduce the impact of a similar outage to a region instead of global.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nStarting at 23:30 on 21 September 2023, some customers experienced a global outage to their Global External Load Balancer data plane for affected projects for the period their configuration was in the bad state. This manifested as HTTP 4xx errors until either the suggested workaround or the Google mitigation was applied. The incident lasted for a period of 1 day, 4 minutes. However, individual customers were impacted for a much shorter period.\nCustomer impact was noted mostly in one specific configuration type of Google front end (GFE) that is used for Internet Network End Groups (NEG) [1] where up to 20% of customers’ queries failed due to missing configuration. At peak, this impact was observed in up to 9.3% of customer’s projects hosted in this specific type of configuration. Impact to customers using other configuration types was minimal to negligible.\n[1] - https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/negs",

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn Thursday, 21 September 2023, Cloud Load Balancing experienced a configuration propagation issue resulting in a failure to serve traffic for some customers. To our Cloud Load Balancing customers whose businesses were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe root cause of the issue was a change in the leader election process of a component of Google Cloud Load Balancer’s configuration management pipeline. This change triggered a race condition in a downstream component in the pipeline, resulting in overwriting some customer configurations with empty configurations.\nThis change of leader election was being done as part of a roll out to increase the resiliency of the system. Google engineers rolled out the change gradually and made use of a canary process to gate progress on correct functionality; however our automated rollout verification did not detect this issue, as in isolation the component rolling out was performing correctly. While the roll out was in progress, the issue was detected by our dataplane monitoring due to the increased rate of 4xx errors being served.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to an issue on 22 September 2023 at 04:51 US/Pacific from dataplane monitoring for HTTP 4xx responses and froze the configuration pipeline to avoid further impact.\nAt 05:15 US/pacific, Google engineers reinstated a snapshot of known good config for the impacted config type, mitigating the dataplane errors for which we had been alerted. At 07:15 US/Pacific the configuration pipeline was un-frozen, following our standard process. However our validations identified an underlying issue that was still present and that impact to the data plane resurfaced after the configuration pipeline was unfrozen.\nBetween 07:15 and 12:40 Google engineers focused on root cause investigation and continuous manual mitigation of impacted project configurations, which were being affected due to natural leader election flips. During this time we identified the root cause component but due to the nature of the issue, were unable to follow our standard rollback procedure resulting in a delay until 16:58, when Google engineers started a custom rollback of the relevant management plane component, which was completed at 23:34.\nOnce this rollback was completed, Google engineers performed additional validations by triggering leader election changes and ensuring that these changes no longer caused the unintended behavior.\nAffected customers were recommended to try making changes to the configuration of their External Application Load Balancer. This resolved URL loading failure issues for impacted customers.\nWe apologize for the length and severity of this incident. We are taking multiple steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future.\n- Identify and resolve the underlying race condition in our configuration lifecycle that resulted in the unintended modifications.\n- Improve tooling and processes to more quickly and safely rollback components in the configuration management system.\n- Improve Google's internal monitoring and visualization to better assess and understand source of 4XX response alerting to expedite detection.\n- The Configuration Management System used by Global Load Balancer is scoped to operate at a project level within the global scope today. This architecture was a key reason for customers experiencing global impact. We had already initiated a program to make these operations happen at a regional level, in every region as part of our ongoing reliability improvement roadmap. This would reduce the impact of a similar outage to a region instead of global.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nStarting at 23:30 on 21 September 2023, some customers experienced a global outage to their Global External Load Balancer data plane for affected projects for the period their configuration was in the bad state. This manifested as HTTP 4xx errors until either the suggested workaround or the Google mitigation was applied. The incident lasted for a period of 1 day, 4 minutes. However, individual customers were impacted for a much shorter period.\nCustomer impact was noted mostly in one specific configuration type of Google front end (GFE) that is used for Internet Network End Groups (NEG) [1] where up to 20% of customers’ queries failed due to missing configuration. At peak, this impact was observed in up to 9.3% of customer’s projects hosted in this specific type of configuration. Impact to customers using other configuration types was minimal to negligible.\n[1] - https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/negs",

The total duration of this incident was 3 hours and 46 minutes.\nTo our Google Cloud customers whose businesses were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nGoogle’s data centers rely on a distributed strongly-consistent file distribution system to perform operations such as name resolution in the data plane, and consist of servers that are used for distributing widely-used data.\nThe root cause of the issue was a significant increase in traffic due to internal changes that generated more tasks than expected. This caused the file distribution system to begin crashing.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue via internal monitoring on 12 September 2023 at 23:46 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Once the nature and scope of the issue became clear, Google engineers began redirecting traffic away from the affected servers, and added more memory resources. This procedure took a few hours because it is a manual process requiring extra care, due to the criticality of the service and it being foundational to data center operations. During this time, some services saw recovery before others, and impact was fully mitigated for all services on 13 September 2023 at 03:32 US/Pacific.\nGoogle is committed preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n* Reviewing our procedures to increase coordination of high-volume internal changes.\n* Investigating ways to minimize recovery time for similar classes of problems in the future.\n* Further improving the resilience of critical data center infrastructure in the face of large load spikes.\nWe apologize for the impact this incident had on our customers and their businesses in the us-central1 region. We are taking immediate steps to prevent a recurrence in the future.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Tuesday, 12 September 2023 from 23:46 to Wednesday, 13 September 2023 at 03:32 US/Pacific, multiple Google Cloud products experienced elevated error rates and request failures in us-central1 which are detailed below:\n### **Google Compute Engine :**\n* Customers may have experienced errors or elevated latencies for API requests compute.instances.insert and compute.instances.start in us-central1, as well as requests to aggregatedList globally.\n* Failed HTTP requests: 24% of projects were impacted\n* Failed VM start and creation: 31% of projects were impacted\nImpact began on Wednesday, 13 September 2023 at 00:05 and was mitigated at 02:40 US/Pacific.

Total duration of impact was 3 hours, 5 minutes.\n### **Google Kubernetes Engine:**\n* Customers may have experienced failed Cluster Creation requests. Up to 4% of such requests failed in us-central1-a (zonal) and us-central1 (regional) during the incident. Additionally, 0.01% of clusters in these locations may have experienced unavailability in their cluster control plane as a result of a cluster upgrade during the incident (zonal clusters only).\nImpact began on Wednesday, 13 September 2023 at 00:55 and was mitigated at 04:00 US/Pacific. Total duration of impact was 3 hours, 5 minutes.\n### **Google Cloud Bigtable:**\n* Affected Cloud Bigtable clusters had elevated latency and error rates in us-central1 for requests to the data api ‘bigtable.googleapis.com ’ in us-central1.\n* Approximately 23.7% of projects experienced over 0.5% error rate during the outage.\nImpact began on Tuesday, 12 September 2023 at 23:57. The first symptoms were detected on Wednesday, 13 September 2023 at 01:00, and the incident was mitigated at 02:20 US/Pacific. Total duration of impact was 2 hours, 23 minutes.\n### **Google Cloud Dataflow:**\n* Less than 1% of new Dataflow Batch and Streaming jobs were unable to initialize in us-central1. Approximately 35% of Dataflow Batch and <1% of Streaming jobs that were running in us-central1 during the incident had performance regressions.\nImpact began on Wednesday, 13 September 2023 at 00:07 and was mitigated at 01:15 US/Pacific. Total duration of impact was 1 hour, 8 minutes.\n### **Google Cloud App Engine:**\n* Google App Engine Flexible deployments, version updates, and deletes failed with DEADLINE_EXCEEDED and INTERNAL errors in us-central1-a.\n* At the peak, 100% of deployments failed during the incident, and on average, 50% of deployments failed.\nImpact began on Wednesday, 13 September 2023 at 00:15 and was mitigated at 00:56 US/Pacific. Total duration of impact was 41 minutes.\n### **Google Cloud SQL:**\n* Google Cloud SQL experienced elevated latency and error rates for instance creations and upgrades in us-central1.\n* At the peak, about 10% of such requests failed or experienced higher latencies.\nImpact began on Wednesday, 13 September 2023 at 00:11 and was mitigated at 00:45 US/Pacific. Total duration of impact was 34 minutes.",

This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe root cause of the issue was an incorrect configuration change made to one of the Apigee load balancers for developer portals. This configuration change caused all the requests that were routed through the affected Apigee load balancer to fail with a default 404 error code.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted by a support case on Monday, 11 September at 07:00 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. They were able to identify a misconfiguration in one of the load balancers, which was caused by a change aimed at improving the load balancer’s performance. Upon identifying the misconfiguration, Google Engineers quickly regenerated the configurations of the affected Apigee load balancer and ensured that both load balancers were properly configured.\nWe apologize for the length and severity of this incident. We are taking the following steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future:\n- Identify the cause of the inconsistent configurations for the developer portal load balancers\n- Improve the change management process for Apigee load balancer changes to prevent similar issues\n- Improve monitoring and visibility to ensure the incorrect configurations are identified proactively\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn 11 September from 04:00 to 12:25 US/Pacific, users experienced elevated error rates with errors like \"Failed to load users\", \"Failed to load zone\" or \"Service Unavailable”, when interacting with the developer portal. Customers also experienced issues authenticating to API portals or updating their portals.",

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn Monday, 11 September 2023, Apigee integrated developer portal customers experienced elevated 5xx responses, issues authenticating to API, and issues updating portals when accessing it via Apigee Edge or Apigee X for a duration of 8 hours and 25 minutes.\nTo our Apigee customers whose business analytics were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe root cause of the issue was an incorrect configuration change made to one of the Apigee load balancers for developer portals. This configuration change caused all the requests that were routed through the affected Apigee load balancer to fail with a default 404 error code.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted by a support case on Monday, 11 September at 07:00 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. They were able to identify a misconfiguration in one of the load balancers, which was caused by a change aimed at improving the load balancer’s performance. Upon identifying the misconfiguration, Google Engineers quickly regenerated the configurations of the affected Apigee load balancer and ensured that both load balancers were properly configured.\nWe apologize for the length and severity of this incident. We are taking the following steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future:\n- Identify the cause of the inconsistent configurations for the developer portal load balancers\n- Improve the change management process for Apigee load balancer changes to prevent similar issues\n- Improve monitoring and visibility to ensure the incorrect configurations are identified proactively\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn 11 September from 04:00 to 12:25 US/Pacific, users experienced elevated error rates with errors like \"Failed to load users\", \"Failed to load zone\" or \"Service Unavailable”, when interacting with the developer portal. Customers also experienced issues authenticating to API portals or updating their portals.",

        "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn Monday, 14 August 2023 starting at 16:11 US/Pacific, Google Cloud Interconnect experienced an outage with underground fiber cables in Montreal, Canada. Customers in the impacted location experienced availability issues and were unable to access Google Cloud services via physical connections for a period of 19 hours and 11 minutes. To our customers whose businesses were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe outage occurred due to a fire in an underground, third-party owned cable chamber that affected a larger leased fiber cable below street level, impacting the availability of the only physical path to the Edge Availability Domains (EADs) [yul-zone1-1944 and yul-zone2-1944](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/concepts/choosing-colocation-facilities#locations-table). The fire affected a fiber conduit that is leveraged by Google to provide inter-zone connectivity.\nAt the time of the fire, this was the only physical path providing interconnect to customers from these EADs. This is not the expected redundancy.\nThe Edge Availability Domains, [yul-zone1-1944 and yul-zone2-1944](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/concepts/choosing-colocation-facilities#locations-table), are planned and built for full redundancy of fiber connections back to the Google backbone network, with no single points of failure in equipment, and fiber paths are verified to be physically diverse along the whole route between Google network locations.\nThe EADs were operating without a usable redundant path due to previous fiber cuts that remained unrepaired. The repairs were not completed due to prematurely updated documentation in our systems to reflect our plans for future migrations, which caused us to believe the inactive fiber status was intentional.\nOther than the impact to Cloud Interconnect, the northamerica-northeast1 (YUL) region was unaffected.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage via our internal systems on 14 August, 16:11 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation.\nGoogle engineering teams worked with the third-party fiber vendor and restored service for Cloud Interconnect location [yul-zone1-1944](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/concepts/choosing-colocation-facilities#locations-table), on Tuesday, 15 August 2023 at 01:06 US/Pacific. Service for [yul-zone2-1944](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/concepts/choosing-colocation-facilities#locations-table), was restored on Tuesday, 15 August at 11:22 US/Pacific.\nThe fire-damaged fiber could not be repaired in place, so the damaged underground cable chamber had to be bypassed physically. This required splicing several hundred fiber links, including the ones leased by Google, which extended the repair timeline.\nSimultaneously, Google attempted to return to service the redundant physical path not affected by the fire. However, this was not immediately successful, and the incident was resolved by the repair of the primary path.\nGoogle restored full redundancy for both EADs (both primary and redundant paths) on 16 August, at 14:55 US/Pacific.\nGoogle Cloud Interconnect offers a 99.99% reliability SLA, for customers who deploy at least two connections in each of two interconnect regions. Customers that had deployed this architecture were not affected by this outage. For more information on this feature, see the following: [Topology for production-level applications overview](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/tutorials/production-level-overview)\nAdditionally, Google is committed to preventing future recurrence by taking the following actions:\n- Improve rules within Google's internal repair prioritization system so that any issue that results in a loss of redundancy for more than one EAD in a region is treated at the highest repair priority, where Google's target is a 24 hour return to service.\n- Ensure that exceptions that occur between the migration and repair process for fibers have a documented escalation process, and that migration processes do not change fiber documentation until immediately after the migration is complete.\n- Complete the migration (both in Montreal and elsewhere) that moves all Interconnect zones to fully active-active connections. This builds upon our existing standard of \"no single failure can affect both EADs in a region\" to a stronger commitment of \"no single failure can affect any EAD\".\n- Ensure that clear notifications for isolation outages are sent proactively to customers.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\n* Starting on 14 August, 16:11 US/Pacific, 100% of customers using Cloud Interconnect in Montreal, Canada experienced unavailability, with customers unable to access Google Cloud services via physical connections in that location.\n* The interconnect location “yul-zone1-1944” was restored 10 hours, 16 minutes before yul-zone2-1944, allowing customers with redundant connectivity to access services via yul-zone1-1944 until yul-zone2-1944 was restored.\n* Other Google Cloud services in northamerica-northeast1 were accessible from interconnects outside of Montreal, Canada.\n---------------",

If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**yul-zone1-1944 Incident Start:** 14 August 2023, 16:11\n**yul-zone1-1944 Incident End:** 15 August 2023, 01:06\n**Duration:** 8 hours, 55 minutes\n**yul-zone2-1944 Incident Start:** 14 August 2023, 16:11\n**yul-zone2-1944 Incident End:** 15 August 2023, 11:22\n**Duration:** 19 hours, 11 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nGoogle Cloud Interconnect.\n**Regions/Zones:** Montreal, Canada Interconnect locations.\n**Description:**\nGoogle Cloud Interconnect experienced an outage with underground fiber cables in Montreal, Canada. The customer impact during the outage was due to two unrelated issues:\nThe [Edge Availability Domains](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/concepts/terminology#edge-availability-domain) - [yul-zone1-1944 and yul-zone2-1944](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/concepts/choosing-colocation-facilities#locations-table) were operating without a usable redundant path due to a previous fiber cut that remained unrepaired. The repairs were not completed due to prematurely updating the documentation in our systems to reflect our plans for future migrations.\nThe outage occurred when a fire broke out in an underground third-party owned cable chamber, which affected a large leased fiber cable below street level, impacting the availability of the only remaining physical path to these Edge Availability Domains. The fire-affected large fiber cable is leveraged by Google to provide inter-zone connectivity. At the time of the fire this was the only physical path between the affected routers providing interconnect to customers.\nGoogle engineering teams worked with the third party fiber vendor and restored service for Cloud Interconnect location [yul-zone1-1944](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/concepts/choosing-colocation-facilities#locations-table) on Tuesday, 2023-08-15 at 01:06 US/Pacific and restored service for [yul-zone2-1944](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/concepts/choosing-colocation-facilities#locations-table) on Tuesday, 2023-08-15 at 11:22 US/Pacific.\nThe fire-damaged fiber could not be repaired in place, so the damaged underground cable chamber had to be bypassed physically. This required splicing over a few hundred fiber links, including the ones leased by Google, which extended the repair timeline.\nSimultaneously, Google attempted to return to service the redundant physical path not affected by the fire, however, this was not immediately successful before splicing efforts completed, resolving the outage. Google is continuing to work with third party vendors to establish all redundant physical paths.\nGoogle will complete a full IR in the following days that will provide additional details.\n**Customer Impact:**\n- Customers using Cloud Interconnect in Montreal, Canada could have experienced availability issues, with customers unable to access Google Cloud services via physical connections in that location. The interconnect location “yul-zone1-1944” was restored 10 hours, 16 minutes before yul-zone2-1944, allowing customers with redundant connectivity to access services via yul-zone1-1944 until yul-zone2-1944 was restored.\n- Google Cloud services in northamerica-northeast1 were accessible from interconnects outside of Montreal, Canada.\n---------------",

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn Monday, 14 August 2023 starting at 16:11 US/Pacific, Google Cloud Interconnect experienced an outage with underground fiber cables in Montreal, Canada. Customers in the impacted location experienced availability issues and were unable to access Google Cloud services via physical connections for a period of 19 hours and 11 minutes. To our customers whose businesses were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe outage occurred due to a fire in an underground, third-party owned cable chamber that affected a larger leased fiber cable below street level, impacting the availability of the only physical path to the Edge Availability Domains (EADs) [yul-zone1-1944 and yul-zone2-1944](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/concepts/choosing-colocation-facilities#locations-table). The fire affected a fiber conduit that is leveraged by Google to provide inter-zone connectivity.\nAt the time of the fire, this was the only physical path providing interconnect to customers from these EADs. This is not the expected redundancy.\nThe Edge Availability Domains, [yul-zone1-1944 and yul-zone2-1944](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/concepts/choosing-colocation-facilities#locations-table), are planned and built for full redundancy of fiber connections back to the Google backbone network, with no single points of failure in equipment, and fiber paths are verified to be physically diverse along the whole route between Google network locations.\nThe EADs were operating without a usable redundant path due to previous fiber cuts that remained unrepaired. The repairs were not completed due to prematurely updated documentation in our systems to reflect our plans for future migrations, which caused us to believe the inactive fiber status was intentional.\nOther than the impact to Cloud Interconnect, the northamerica-northeast1 (YUL) region was unaffected.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage via our internal systems on 14 August, 16:11 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation.\nGoogle engineering teams worked with the third-party fiber vendor and restored service for Cloud Interconnect location [yul-zone1-1944](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/concepts/choosing-colocation-facilities#locations-table), on Tuesday, 15 August 2023 at 01:06 US/Pacific. Service for [yul-zone2-1944](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/concepts/choosing-colocation-facilities#locations-table), was restored on Tuesday, 15 August at 11:22 US/Pacific.\nThe fire-damaged fiber could not be repaired in place, so the damaged underground cable chamber had to be bypassed physically. This required splicing several hundred fiber links, including the ones leased by Google, which extended the repair timeline.\nSimultaneously, Google attempted to return to service the redundant physical path not affected by the fire. However, this was not immediately successful, and the incident was resolved by the repair of the primary path.\nGoogle restored full redundancy for both EADs (both primary and redundant paths) on 16 August, at 14:55 US/Pacific.\nGoogle Cloud Interconnect offers a 99.99% reliability SLA, for customers who deploy at least two connections in each of two interconnect regions. Customers that had deployed this architecture were not affected by this outage. For more information on this feature, see the following: [Topology for production-level applications overview](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/tutorials/production-level-overview)\nAdditionally, Google is committed to preventing future recurrence by taking the following actions:\n- Improve rules within Google's internal repair prioritization system so that any issue that results in a loss of redundancy for more than one EAD in a region is treated at the highest repair priority, where Google's target is a 24 hour return to service.\n- Ensure that exceptions that occur between the migration and repair process for fibers have a documented escalation process, and that migration processes do not change fiber documentation until immediately after the migration is complete.\n- Complete the migration (both in Montreal and elsewhere) that moves all Interconnect zones to fully active-active connections. This builds upon our existing standard of \"no single failure can affect both EADs in a region\" to a stronger commitment of \"no single failure can affect any EAD\".\n- Ensure that clear notifications for isolation outages are sent proactively to customers.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\n* Starting on 14 August, 16:11 US/Pacific, 100% of customers using Cloud Interconnect in Montreal, Canada experienced unavailability, with customers unable to access Google Cloud services via physical connections in that location.\n* The interconnect location “yul-zone1-1944” was restored 10 hours, 16 minutes before yul-zone2-1944, allowing customers with redundant connectivity to access services via yul-zone1-1944 until yul-zone2-1944 was restored.\n* Other Google Cloud services in northamerica-northeast1 were accessible from interconnects outside of Montreal, Canada.\n---------------",

        "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn Friday, 28 July 2023 from 10:17 to 15:52 US/Pacific, Dialogflow Customer Experience (Dialogflow CX) and Dialogflow Essentials (Dialogflow ES) experienced elevated DEADLINE_EXCEEDED, UNAVAILABLE errors and latency for certain functions for a duration of 5 hours, 35 minutes. High error rates were seen for CreateConversation, CreateParticipant, and (Streaming)AnalyzeContent functionalities. Any customer applications or services dependent on Dialogflow “global-dialogflow.googleapis.com” or “dialogflow.googleapis.com” would have experienced service interruptions. Only [“Global” location](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/region#avail\n) was affected by the issue and no other locations were affected.\nTo our Dialogflow customers whose applications were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe root cause of the issue is exhaustion of thread and memory resources in the component that handles incoming and outgoing API requests. The exhaustion was triggered by recent code changes to improve the efficiency of interactions between Dialogflow API, Pub/Sub messaging, and internal authentication services, and by the unexpected behavior of some incoming queries.\nOne of our largest customers began trying out a new, private feature in Dialogflow. Their client behaved in an unexpected way, exposing a potential resource exhaustion involving Cloud Pub/Sub subscriptions, which we use to keep conversation state synchronized between multiple platforms. To create conversations using Dialogflow, topic subscriptions are initialized. Once conversations are completed, these subscriptions are cleared. As a result of the recent code change, customer projects that initiated conversations without completing them started to accumulate topic subscriptions, leading to a backlog.\nThe resource exhaustion only became apparent after we received a large volume of traffic that exhibited this unusual behavior on 28 July 2023. This manifested in our servers as spiking memory usage and thread exhaustion. When the pool of available threads began to dwindle, the incident started impacting other customers as well.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue by an internal monitoring system on 28 July 2023 at 10:36 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. From the initial analysis, Google engineers found that the majority of errors were from one data center. At 11:25 US/Pacific, a mitigation was attempted by directing the traffic away from that data center. This attempt did not resolve the errors, instead the issue moved to another data center. After further investigation, the engineering team identified that many threads were waiting for specific event completion. Google engineers temporarily disabled those events at 13:10 US/Pacific. This showed signs of improvement in error rate and latency. However, around 30 minutes later, the issue re-appeared.\nGoogle engineers continued the investigation and identified a rollout from 17 July 2023 to be contributing to the issue and initiated a rollback at 14:20 US/Pacific. At 15:25 US/Pacific, the engineering team started noticing an improvement in error rate, and the customer impact was completely mitigated at 15:52 US/Pacific.\nGoogle is committed preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n* Implement a fix to thread resource exhaustion triggered by queries that do not complete the conversation properly.\n* Implement safeguards to gradually roll out changes to limit the scope of impact.\n* Implement monitoring for queries that do not exit properly upon completion of conversations.\n* Improve traffic isolation by implementing separate resource pools for different types of API requests.\n* Improve traffic handling in the component that handles the API requests by implementing a safety mechanism that allows for graceful handling of overload conditions.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Friday, 28 July 2023 from 10:17 to 15:52 US/Pacific, requests to Dialogflow CX and Dialogflow ES experienced elevated DEADLINE_EXCEEDED errors and latency issues. - Around 9% of overall traffic to “global-dialogflow.googleapis.com” or “dialogflow.googleapis.com” was experiencing elevated error rates and latency. - Based on analysis from the previous day requests, we estimate that around 25% of expected traffic to [“Global” location](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/region#avail\n) was served UNAVAILABLE errors.\nDepending on the workload and query distribution, some customers may have noticed higher error rates than the rates provided above.\n-------------------------",

High error rates were seen for CreateConversation, CreateParticipant, and (Streaming)AnalyzeContent functionalities. Any customer applications or services dependent on Dialogflow “global-dialogflow.googleapis.com” or “dialogflow.googleapis.com” would have experienced service interruptions. Only [“Global” location](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/region#avail\n) was affected by the issue and no other locations were affected.\nTo our Dialogflow customers whose applications were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s availability.\n## Root Cause\nThe root cause of the issue is exhaustion of thread and memory resources in the component that handles incoming and outgoing API requests. The exhaustion was triggered by recent code changes to improve the efficiency of interactions between Dialogflow API, Pub/Sub messaging, and internal authentication services, and by the unexpected behavior of some incoming queries.\nOne of our largest customers began trying out a new, private feature in Dialogflow. Their client behaved in an unexpected way, exposing a potential resource exhaustion involving Cloud Pub/Sub subscriptions, which we use to keep conversation state synchronized between multiple platforms. To create conversations using Dialogflow, topic subscriptions are initialized. Once conversations are completed, these subscriptions are cleared. As a result of the recent code change, customer projects that initiated conversations without completing them started to accumulate topic subscriptions, leading to a backlog.\nThe resource exhaustion only became apparent after we received a large volume of traffic that exhibited this unusual behavior on 28 July 2023. This manifested in our servers as spiking memory usage and thread exhaustion. When the pool of available threads began to dwindle, the incident started impacting other customers as well.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue by an internal monitoring system on 28 July 2023 at 10:36 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. From the initial analysis, Google engineers found that the majority of errors were from one data center. At 11:25 US/Pacific, a mitigation was attempted by directing the traffic away from that data center. This attempt did not resolve the errors, instead the issue moved to another data center. After further investigation, the engineering team identified that many threads were waiting for specific event completion. Google engineers temporarily disabled those events at 13:10 US/Pacific. This showed signs of improvement in error rate and latency. However, around 30 minutes later, the issue re-appeared.\nGoogle engineers continued the investigation and identified a rollout from 17 July 2023 to be contributing to the issue and initiated a rollback at 14:20 US/Pacific. At 15:25 US/Pacific, the engineering team started noticing an improvement in error rate, and the customer impact was completely mitigated at 15:52 US/Pacific.\nGoogle is committed preventing a repeat of this issue in the future and is completing the following actions:\n* Implement a fix to thread resource exhaustion triggered by queries that do not complete the conversation properly.\n* Implement safeguards to gradually roll out changes to limit the scope of impact.\n* Implement monitoring for queries that do not exit properly upon completion of conversations.\n* Improve traffic isolation by implementing separate resource pools for different types of API requests.\n* Improve traffic handling in the component that handles the API requests by implementing a safety mechanism that allows for graceful handling of overload conditions.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Friday, 28 July 2023 from 10:17 to 15:52 US/Pacific, requests to Dialogflow CX and Dialogflow ES experienced elevated DEADLINE_EXCEEDED errors and latency issues. - Around 9% of overall traffic to “global-dialogflow.googleapis.com” or “dialogflow.googleapis.com” was experiencing elevated error rates and latency. - Based on analysis from the previous day requests, we estimate that around 25% of expected traffic to [“Global” location](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/region#avail\n) was served UNAVAILABLE errors.\nDepending on the workload and query distribution, some customers may have noticed higher error rates than the rates provided above.\n-------------------------",

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 25 July 2023 at 06:30\n**Incident End:** 29 July 2023 at 08:03\n**Duration:** 4 days, 1 hour, 33 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nChronicle Security\n**Regions/Zones:** Multi-regions: us\n**Description:**\nStarting on Tuesday, 25 July at 06:30, Chronicle Security began experiencing a slow down in data processing in the US region. This resulted in stale data for Unified Data Model (UDM) [1] Search and delayed threat detections. Chronicle's data processing returned to normal for new events on Wednesday, 27 July at 13:45, with the last events in the incident window processed by customer rules by Saturday, 29 July at 08:03. From a preliminary analysis, the root cause was a surge in traffic from a single customer that occurred on Saturday 22 July. The traffic surge was exacerbated by a pipeline that did not have sufficient rate limiting and ultimately overloaded our persistence layer.\nGoogle engineers mitigated the issue by temporarily limiting the traffic from the high volume customer, removing inter-dependency from as many pipelines as possible, and by disabling several non-critical pipelines.\n**Customer Impact:**\nAll features in Chronicle Security were still working but the impacted users could have got stale data while searching for UDM events and may have experienced missed threat detections for recently ingested telemetry.\n[1] - https://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/event-processing/udm-overview",

Searches with raw log should be targeted to a log type or string/regex.\nCustomers can also leverage indexed UDM searches to surface up to date results. Indexed UDM searches must leverage one of the following UDM fields and one of the following UDM nouns. These searches must be an exact match on a field, which means they cannot include a REGEX expression or REF list.

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 25 July 2023 at 06:30\n**Incident End:** 29 July 2023 at 08:03\n**Duration:** 4 days, 1 hour, 33 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nChronicle Security\n**Regions/Zones:** Multi-regions: us\n**Description:**\nStarting on Tuesday, 25 July at 06:30, Chronicle Security began experiencing a slow down in data processing in the US region. This resulted in stale data for Unified Data Model (UDM) [1] Search and delayed threat detections. Chronicle's data processing returned to normal for new events on Wednesday, 27 July at 13:45, with the last events in the incident window processed by customer rules by Saturday, 29 July at 08:03. From a preliminary analysis, the root cause was a surge in traffic from a single customer that occurred on Saturday 22 July. The traffic surge was exacerbated by a pipeline that did not have sufficient rate limiting and ultimately overloaded our persistence layer.\nGoogle engineers mitigated the issue by temporarily limiting the traffic from the high volume customer, removing inter-dependency from as many pipelines as possible, and by disabling several non-critical pipelines.\n**Customer Impact:**\nAll features in Chronicle Security were still working but the impacted users could have got stale data while searching for UDM events and may have experienced missed threat detections for recently ingested telemetry.\n[1] - https://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/event-processing/udm-overview",

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 13 July 2023 at 07:55\n**Incident End:** 21 July 2023 at 02:29\n**Duration:** 7 days, 18 hours, 34 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nCloud Data Fusion\n**Regions/Zones:** asia-northeast2, me-west1, us-east1, us-east4, us-east5, us-central1, us-south1, us-west2\n**Description:**\nCloud Data Fusion experienced an issue where updating an instance created before 14 July 2023 would fail.\nOur preliminary analysis indicates that the root cause is a recent change made to access controls on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters in order to improve security. Due to this change, the Cloud Data Fusion instances using older service accounts did not have the appropriate permissions to apply instance updates.\nGoogle Engineers mitigated the issue by updating affected instances to use the correct service account.\n**Customer Impact:**\nCustomers from the impacted regions would have observed failures during instance updates for instances that were created before 14 July 2023. However, there was no known instance usage impact for the customers who did not update their instances.",

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 13 July 2023 at 07:55\n**Incident End:** 21 July 2023 at 02:29\n**Duration:** 7 days, 18 hours, 34 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nCloud Data Fusion\n**Regions/Zones:** asia-northeast2, me-west1, us-east1, us-east4, us-east5, us-central1, us-south1, us-west2\n**Description:**\nCloud Data Fusion experienced an issue where updating an instance created before 14 July 2023 would fail.\nOur preliminary analysis indicates that the root cause is a recent change made to access controls on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters in order to improve security. Due to this change, the Cloud Data Fusion instances using older service accounts did not have the appropriate permissions to apply instance updates.\nGoogle Engineers mitigated the issue by updating affected instances to use the correct service account.\n**Customer Impact:**\nCustomers from the impacted regions would have observed failures during instance updates for instances that were created before 14 July 2023. However, there was no known instance usage impact for the customers who did not update their instances.",

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 06 July 2023 at 07:13\n**Incident End:** 18 July 2023 at 07:27\n**Duration:** 12 days, 14 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nGoogle Kubernetes Engine - Logging\n**Regions/Zones:** Global\n**Description:**\nGoogle Kubernetes Engine (GKE) experienced an issue with unexpected additional log messages in GKE cluster logs. The extra log messages consumed additional logging API write quota, and a subset of customers had quota exhaustion issues. The issue affected both standard and autopilot clusters at GKE versions 1.24.x and above. From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue is a roll out of a new version of the component responsible for processing logs.\nDuring the outage, customers were provided with a workaround to request a quota increase for Logging API and/or to apply log exclusions to avoid storing the additional messages. The issue was mitigated by a gradual fix roll out to the affected clusters.\n**Customer Impact:**\nAffected Customers would have seen unexpected additional log messages in GKE cluster logs. Following are the Error/Warning log entries:\n- Failed to get record: decoder: failed to decode payload: EOF\n- Cannot parse '0609 05:31:59.491654' after %L\n- Invalid time format %m%d %H:%M:%S.%L%z for '0609 05:31:59.490647'\n--------------------",

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 06 July 2023 at 07:13\n**Incident End:** 18 July 2023 at 07:27\n**Duration:** 12 days, 14 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nGoogle Kubernetes Engine - Logging\n**Regions/Zones:** Global\n**Description:**\nGoogle Kubernetes Engine (GKE) experienced an issue with unexpected additional log messages in GKE cluster logs. The extra log messages consumed additional logging API write quota, and a subset of customers had quota exhaustion issues. The issue affected both standard and autopilot clusters at GKE versions 1.24.x and above. From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue is a roll out of a new version of the component responsible for processing logs.\nDuring the outage, customers were provided with a workaround to request a quota increase for Logging API and/or to apply log exclusions to avoid storing the additional messages. The issue was mitigated by a gradual fix roll out to the affected clusters.\n**Customer Impact:**\nAffected Customers would have seen unexpected additional log messages in GKE cluster logs. Following are the Error/Warning log entries:\n- Failed to get record: decoder: failed to decode payload: EOF\n- Cannot parse '0609 05:31:59.491654' after %L\n- Invalid time format %m%d %H:%M:%S.%L%z for '0609 05:31:59.490647'\n--------------------",

If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 4 July 2023 at 18:47\n**Incident End:** 4 July 2023 at 21:03\n**Duration:** 2 hours, 16 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nCloud Spanner\n**Regions/Zones:** us-central1, asia-south1, europe-west2, europe-west9\n**Description:**\nA limited number of Cloud Spanner users experienced errors while using control plane APIs and while creating new sessions in the us-central1 for a duration of 2 hours and 16 minutes. A limited number of users of europe-west2, europe-west9 and asia-south1 regions were impacted intermittently for a duration of 5 mins between 20:11 and 21:03 PDT. From our preliminary analysis, the root cause was an incorrect configuration in the way operational metadata was handled, causing an overload on metadata operations for the regions mentioned.\n**Customer Impact:** Customers could have experienced one or more of the following :\n- Customers with existing sessions may not have observed any errors, However, upon reconnection, customers may have experienced errors stating “deadline exceeded” when creating new sessions.\n- Errors stating ”deadline exceeded” when using the Control Plane API.\n- Errors or missing entries while viewing their instances and databases in Cloud Console.",

If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 4 July 2023 at 18:47\n**Incident End:** 4 July 2023 at 21:03\n**Duration:** 2 hours, 16 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nCloud Spanner\n**Regions/Zones:** us-central1, asia-south1, europe-west2, europe-west9\n**Description:**\nA limited number of Cloud Spanner users experienced errors while using control plane APIs and while creating new sessions in the us-central1 for a duration of 2 hours and 16 minutes. A limited number of users of europe-west2, europe-west9 and asia-south1 regions were impacted intermittently for a duration of 5 mins between 20:11 and 21:03 PDT. From our preliminary analysis, the root cause was an incorrect configuration in the way operational metadata was handled, causing an overload on metadata operations for the regions mentioned.\n**Customer Impact:** Customers could have experienced one or more of the following :\n- Customers with existing sessions may not have observed any errors, However, upon reconnection, customers may have experienced errors stating “deadline exceeded” when creating new sessions.\n- Errors stating ”deadline exceeded” when using the Control Plane API.\n- Errors or missing entries while viewing their instances and databases in Cloud Console.",

The trigger for this outage was a new deployment for some Cloud IAM workloads in the us-east5 region.

As Cloud services detected the new IAM workloads and started to send them authentication requests, they received in return authentication proof tokens that could not be verified, resulting in failed workflows. The issue was mitigated by redirecting traffic from the affected IAM workloads.\n**Customer Impact:**\n## Cloud SQL\n- 1 failed update operation resulting in downtime for HA instance\n- 4 failed creations\n- Missing metrics for up to 50 minutes by <150 instances\n## Cloud Pub/Sub\n- Affected customers experienced elevated authentication errors.\n## Pub/Sub Lite\n- Affected customers experienced elevated authentication errors.\n## Cloud Bigtable\n- Affected customers experienced elevated 401 authentication errors.\n## Data Catalog\n- Affected customers experienced elevated 401 authentication errors.\n## Google Compute Engine\n- Affected customers experienced elevated 401 authentication errors.\n- About 50% of users were impacted in us-east5-c (300 QPS of 600) from 10:21 -11:05 a.m.\n## Cloud Spanner\n- Affected customers experienced elevated 401 authentication errors.\n## Google Cloud Storage\n- -Affected customers experienced elevated 400 authentication errors.\n- <1% of customers were affected from 10:20 - 11:09 a.m.\n- <1% QPS of total traffic received errors during this time peaking at around 1100 QPS before the incident was mitigated.",

Production jobs use a public key to verify the signature from this authentication platform. This public key is periodically rotated to increase security.\nIn this case, updated public keys were successfully rolled out to >99.99% of machines but failed to roll out to one machine before the previous keys became stale. Tasks scheduled on machines with stale keys returned an internal authentication failure that was translated to an access-denied error (HTTP 403) in the us-west1 region and the US-multi-region. This resulted in a small number of customers experiencing intermittent access denied errors despite having correct credentials.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue via a customer support case on 19 June 2023 at 07:29 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Engineers identified an affected machine that was using a stale public key as part of our internal authentication infrastructure. Engineers took standard mitigating actions, by stopping the serving path process within 10 minutes of identifying the affected machine, and confirmed full mitigation within another 4 minutes. Services were fully recovered on 19 June 2023 at 14:14 US/Pacific,\nGoogle is committed to preventing future recurrence, and we are taking the following actions:\n- Immediately complete an audit of all machines containing public keys to find the rare cases of unobserved stale public keys and reinstall those machines to prevent unnecessary authorization failures.\n- Optimize detection of stale public keys.\n- Design and implement a long term solution eliminating rare edge case failures in key rotation for Cloud authentication infrastructure.",

If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 19 June 2023 at 07:29\n**Incident End:** 19 June 2023 at 14:14\n**Duration:** 6 hours, 45 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nGoogle Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Google Cloud Storage (GCS)\n**Regions/Zones:** us-west1, multiregion-us\n**Description:**\nGoogle Kubernetes Engine in the us-west1 region and Google Cloud Storage services in us-west1 and multiregion-us regions returned intermittent 403 errors for customers for a period of 6 hours and 45 minutes.\nFrom our preliminary analysis, the incident was caused by inconsistent keys being used by one of our machines as part of our internal authenticator infrastructure. This led to a failure to verify all requests that were handled by the affected machine.\nGoogle will share a full Incident Report in the following days that will provide a detailed root cause. Google is immediately starting an audit of other machines containing authorization tokens to ensure that the incident is not repeated. We are also working on a permanent fix to prevent this situation from happening in the future, and improving our ability to quickly detect this issue if it ever happens again.\n**Customer Impact:**\nGoogle Cloud Storage customers in the impacted regions would have received intermittent 403 errors on accessing and/or writing into the GCS bucket. Customers may have also received errors stating that the request had invalid authentication credentials, despite using a valid account.\nA small amount of Google Kubernetes Engine customers in the us-west1 region may have received intermittent 403 errors on GKE node when calling GKE APIs.",

      "text": "# Incident Report\n## Summary\nOn 19 June 2023 at 07:29 US/Pacific, some Google Cloud customers in us-west1 and multiregion-us received intermittent “403 access denied errors” while using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) or attempting to access Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for a duration of 6 hours and 45 minutes.\n## Root Cause\nGoogle Cloud’s common authentication infrastructure provides short-lived, forwardable internal credentials for establishing user presence. Production jobs use a public key to verify the signature from this authentication platform. This public key is periodically rotated to increase security.\nIn this case, updated public keys were successfully rolled out to >99.99% of machines but failed to roll out to one machine before the previous keys became stale. Tasks scheduled on machines with stale keys returned an internal authentication failure that was translated to an access-denied error (HTTP 403) in the us-west1 region and the US-multi-region. This resulted in a small number of customers experiencing intermittent access denied errors despite having correct credentials.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue via a customer support case on 19 June 2023 at 07:29 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Engineers identified an affected machine that was using a stale public key as part of our internal authentication infrastructure. Engineers took standard mitigating actions, by stopping the serving path process within 10 minutes of identifying the affected machine, and confirmed full mitigation within another 4 minutes. Services were fully recovered on 19 June 2023 at 14:14 US/Pacific,\nGoogle is committed to preventing future recurrence, and we are taking the following actions:\n- Immediately complete an audit of all machines containing public keys to find the rare cases of unobserved stale public keys and reinstall those machines to prevent unnecessary authorization failures.\n- Optimize detection of stale public keys.\n- Design and implement a long term solution eliminating rare edge case failures in key rotation for Cloud authentication infrastructure.",
