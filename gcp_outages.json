Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 25 July 2021 00:00\n**Incident End:** 03 Aug 2022 09:45\n**Duration:** 9 days, 9 hours, 45 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:** - Google Cloud Console - Billing Export - Google Cloud Billing\n**Regions/Zones:** Global\n**Description:**\nGoogle Cloud Billing usage reporting experienced issues and may have shown incomplete data for a duration of 9 days, 9 hours, and 5 minutes. From preliminary analysis this was due to an issue with a recent rollout to the Google Compute Engine (GCE) control plane. The rollout produced unforeseen data change that caused a mismatch in Billing, and eventually a delay in the usage reporting.\nComplete Usage data for all days in July are now available in the Cloud Billing Console and BigQuery Export. There was no impact to the invoices for July, which were issued on 1 August 2022.\n**Customer Impact:**\nAffected customers experienced the following: - Customers may have experienced delays in viewing real-time product usage information in the Cloud Billing Console or in BigQuery export, if used. - Cloud Billing usage reporting experienced issues and may have shown inaccurate or incomplete data. - Some customers may have seen up to double their instance usage being billed.",

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 25 July 2021 00:00\n**Incident End:** 03 Aug 2022 09:45\n**Duration:** 9 days, 9 hours, 45 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:** - Google Cloud Console - Billing Export - Google Cloud Billing\n**Regions/Zones:** Global\n**Description:**\nGoogle Cloud Billing usage reporting experienced issues and may have shown incomplete data for a duration of 9 days, 9 hours, and 5 minutes. From preliminary analysis this was due to an issue with a recent rollout to the Google Compute Engine (GCE) control plane. The rollout produced unforeseen data change that caused a mismatch in Billing, and eventually a delay in the usage reporting.\nComplete Usage data for all days in July are now available in the Cloud Billing Console and BigQuery Export. There was no impact to the invoices for July, which were issued on 1 August 2022.\n**Customer Impact:**\nAffected customers experienced the following: - Customers may have experienced delays in viewing real-time product usage information in the Cloud Billing Console or in BigQuery export, if used. - Cloud Billing usage reporting experienced issues and may have shown inaccurate or incomplete data. - Some customers may have seen up to double their instance usage being billed.",

Europe-west2-b and europe-west2-c are not impacted for VMs. We have fixed the previously occurring issues when creating new Persistent Disk devices. Zonal autoscaling for europe-west2-a is impacted for customers who suffered VM terminations.\nDescription: We are experiencing an issue with Google Compute Engine beginning at Tuesday, 2022-07-19 08:10 US/Pacific.\nOur engineering team continues to investigate the issue.\nThere has been a cooling related failure in one of our buildings that hosts zone europe-west2-a for region europe-west2. This caused a partial failure of capacity in that zone, leading to VM terminations and a loss of machines for a small set of our customers. We’re working hard to get the cooling back on-line and create capacity in that zone. We do not anticipate further impact in zone europe-west2-a and currently running VMs should not be impacted. A small percentage of replicated Persistent Disk devices are running in single redundant mode.\nIn order to prevent damage to machines and an extended outage, we have powered down part of the zone and are limiting GCE preemptible launches. We are working to restore redundancy for any remaining impacted replicated Persistent Disk devices.\nWe will provide an update by Tuesday, 2022-07-19 15:00 US/Pacific with current details. We apologize to all who are affected by the disruption.\nDiagnosis: Customers impacted by this issue would have seen abnormal VM terminations for a small set of their VMs. We’re working on identifying and communicating with all affected customers.\nWorkaround: For customers who have experienced a VM failure in europe-west2-a, we recommend launching new instances in europe-west2-b and europe-west2-c.

        "text": "## Incident Report\n**Summary:**\nOn Tuesday, 19 July 2022 at 06:33 US/Pacific, a simultaneous failure of multiple, redundant cooling systems in one of the data centers that hosts the zone europe-west2-a impacted multiple Google Cloud services. This resulted in some customers experiencing service unavailability for impacted products.\nTo our customers whose businesses were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps (detailed in the **Remediation & Prevention** section below) to improve the region's resilience.\n***Regional Impact***\nA number of regional Google Cloud services experienced impact during this incident, despite regional services being designed to survive the failure of a single zone. Upon investigation we have found two key contributing factors which led to these regional impacts: * At the start of the incident, we inadvertently modified traffic routing for internal services to avoid all three zones in the europe-west2 region, rather than just the impacted europe-west2-a zone. We corrected this on 19 July 2022 at 12:35 US/Pacific. * Our regional storage services, including GCS and BigQuery, replicate customer data across multiple zones. Due to the regional traffic routing change, they were unable to access any replica for a number of storage objects. This prevented customers from reading these objects until the traffic routing was corrected, at which point access was immediately restored.\n***Cooling System Impact Duration***\nGoogle engineers powered down the data center that hosted a portion of the impacted zone europe-west2-a on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 at 10:05 US/Pacific while the cooling system was repaired. The cooling system was repaired at 14:13 US/Pacific. The total duration of the cooling system failure impact was 4 hours, 8 minutes.\n***Cloud Service Restoration Duration***\nGoogle engineers began service restoration once the cooling system was repaired on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 at 14:13 US/Pacific. Cloud services were restored to operation by Wednesday, 20 July 2022 at 04:28 US/Pacific.\nThe duration of impact on Cloud services spans the window from 10:05 US/Pacific on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 (when a portion of europe-west2-a was powered down), to 04:28 US/Pacific on Wednesday, 20 July 2022, when Cloud services were restored; a total of 18 hours, 23 minutes.\n***Long Tail Duration***\nAfter the initial restoration of service to the zone, a small number of Google Compute Engine instances required additional work by our engineers to restore them to normal operations. This manifested as unavailable instances in GCE, and unavailable instances in products and services that rely on Google Compute Engine, such as Cloud SQL. This was fully mitigated on Wednesday, 20 July 2022 at 21:20 US/Pacific and the incident was closed with all services restored.\nFor the instances in this long tail, impact duration spans the window from the initial power down (at 10:05 US/Pacific on Tuesday, 19 July 2022) to the eventual full mitigation (at 21:20 US/Pacific on Wednesday, 20 July 2022); a total of 35 hours, 15 minutes.\nGoogle is conducting a detailed analysis of the systems and processes involved in both the cooling failure and the service recovery, with specific followup AIs identified below.\n**Root Cause:**\nOne of the data centers that hosts zone europe-west2-a could not maintain a safe operating temperature due to a simultaneous failure of multiple, redundant cooling systems combined with the extraordinarily high outside temperatures. We powered down this part of the zone to prevent an even longer outage or damage to machines. This caused a partial failure of capacity in that zone, leading to instance terminations, service degradation, and networking issues for a subset of customers.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nGoogle engineers were alerted to an issue affecting two cooling systems in one of the data centers that hosts europe-west2-a on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 at 06:33 US/Pacific and began an investigation. Engineers were engaged at 07:02 and began assessing viable mitigations. At 10:05, our engineers decided to power down servers in the impacted data center within europe-west2-a to prevent an even longer outage and further impact to infrastructure in the zone.\nThe cooling system was repaired at 14:13, and we restored our services by Wednesday, 20 July 2022, at 04:28 US/Pacific. A small subset of customers experienced residual effects which were fully mitigated by 21:20.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a future recurrence and improving recovery times by taking the following actions: * A small number of services experienced problems in zonal failover automation. We will repair and carefully re-test our failover automation to ensure stronger resilience in our failover protocols during large scale events such as this one. * We will investigate and develop more advanced methods to progressively decrease the thermal load within a single data center space, reducing the probability that a full shutdown is required. * Our initial recovery of impacted services once cooling was restored was 14 hours, 15 minutes. Additionally, the recovery of the long tail of impacted Google Compute Engine instances and related services was an additional 16 hours, 52 minutes. We are examining our procedures, tooling, and automated recovery systems for gaps to substantially improve our recovery times in the future. * Google engineers are actively conducting a detailed analysis of the cooling system failure that triggered this incident. * Google engineers will be conducting an audit of cooling system equipment and standards across the data centers that house Google Cloud globally.\n**Detailed Description of Impact:**\nOn Tuesday, 19 July 2022 from 06:33 to Wednesday, 20 July 2022 21:20 US/Pacific, some customers may have experienced high latency or errors in multiple Google Cloud services in the impacted location as detailed below:\n**Infrastructure Services**\n* **Google Compute Engine:** As data center temperatures started to increase, on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 at 08:06 US/Pacific Compute Engine terminated 42% of the Preemptible VMs (PVMs) across the europe-west2 region to reduce thermal load in zone europe-west2-a and ensure space for zonal failover activities in zones europe-west2-b and europe-west2-c. When we proceeded to power down the impacted data center to mitigate the cooling overload on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 at 10:07 US/Pacific, Compute Engine terminated all VMs in the impacted data center, representing approximately 35% of the VMs in the europe-west2-a zone. We were able to re-enable PVM launches in the running europe-west2-b and europe-west2-c zones at 13:50 US/Pacific. Power was restored on 19 July 2022 at 14:13 US/Pacific, at which point we began the recovery process for Compute Engine. To ensure a safe restoration, the team carefully sequenced the startup of the services powering Compute Engine. This process completed and the majority of VMs came back online starting at 20:18 US/Pacific. We enabled PVMs once the majority of the other VMs were running at 21:27 US/Pacific.The total impact duration was 12 hours, 12 minutes. A small number of VMs (approximately 0.6% of the europe-west2-a zone) encountered conflicts in our control plane state, requiring a manual reconciliation process. We completed this reconciliation for the “long tail” of all VMs on Thursday, 21 July 2022 at 02:32 US/Pacific. A small number of control plane requests to delete missing VMs during the incident required manual resolution, which was completed at 15:50 US/Pacific. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Thursday, 21 July 2022 20:18 US/Pacific\n* **Persistent Disk (PD):** Approximately 38% of Persistent Disk volumes in zone europe-west2-a were unavailable from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 09:13 US/Pacific. Affected customers would observe unresponsive disks or I/O errors. In most cases, the GCE instances using these volumes were terminated shortly afterward, but about 1% of the unavailable Persistent Disk volumes in zone europe-west2-a were attached to instances that remained online throughout the incident. Approximately 96% of Persistent Disk volumes recovered automatically by 20:30 US/Pacific, but the remainder required additional work to recover, which completed on Wednesday, 20 July 2022 03:10 US/Pacific. Additionally, about 11% of Regional Persistent Disk volumes in the europe-west2 region experienced high disk latency at the beginning of the incident. Most of the Regional Persistent Disk volumes successfully detected the fault in zone europe-west2-a and switched to unreplicated mode, but about 8% of Regional Persistent Disk volumes in the europe-west2 region were unable to correctly detect the fault until the Persistent Disk team forced them into unreplicated mode, which completed around 11:50 US/Pacific. About 17% of Regional Persistent Disk customers in the europe-west2 region experienced errors performing control plane operations, including creating, deleting, attaching, detaching, and snapshotting Regional Persistent Disk volumes from 19 July 2022 07:18 US/Pacific to 13:40 US/Pacific as an unintended side effect of mitigation efforts. As a result of mitigation efforts, 38% of customers were unable to create new Persistent Disk volumes in zone europe-west2-a from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 11:16 US/Pacific to 20 July 2022 02:56 US/Pacific. Additionally, 48% of customers were unable to create new Persistent Disk volumes in zones europe-west2-b and europe-west2-c from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 10:23 US/Pacific to 11:36 US/Pacific. The Persistent Disk snapshot service was unavailable for 38% of customers in zone europe-west2-a from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 from 08:11 US/Pacific to 21:29 US/Pacific. During this time, affected customers could not create new Persistent Disk snapshots from disks located in zone europe-west2-a nor restore snapshots and disk images to disks in zone europe-west2-a. The total impact duration was 12 hours, 16 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Wednesday, 20 July 2022 03:10 US/Pacific\n* **Google Cloud Storage:** On Tuesday, 19 July 2022 between 07:18 and 08:54 US/Pacific, ReadObject availability for buckets located in europe-west2 dropped to approximately 86%, and the entire region's availability to 96%. This impacted 24% of customer projects within this region. Customers would have received HTTP 500s when reading previously written data. All other operations, as well as read for new ingress, or data that was outside of the affected zones were not impacted. The total impact duration was 96 minutes. Google Cloud Storage (GCS) stores replicas in at least 2 independent colossus clusters. As a regional (not zonal) product, GCS leverages placement algorithms to ensure locations, network, and data center diversity when selecting colossus clusters [1]. There was a legacy placement algorithm isolated to just the europe-west2 region allowing for three colossus clusters in the region to be impacted by the same underlying issue relating to a single data center. In a small number of cases GCS had replicated regional data residing in two offline clusters, and subsequently some customers were unable to access and read some of their existing regional scoped data when the regional clusters were taken offline. Writes and other operations were not impacted. [1] - https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/storage-data-transfer/a-peek-behind-colossus-googles-file-system ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 08:54 US/Pacific.\n**Other Services**\n* **API Gateway:** ~47% of projects with traffic experienced an elevated number of spikes in 5xx responses in europe-west2 on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 from 07:20 to 14:00 US/Pacific. Affected customers observed 5xx responses from their API Gateways. The total impact duration was 6 hours, 40 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 14:00 US/Pacific.\n* **Cloud Bigtable:** ~70% of unreplicated Bigtable instances in europe-west2-a experienced 100% data plane unavailability from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 07:05 to Wednesday, 20 July 2022 02:20 US/Pacific. We observed failed control plane operations for 11% of instances that contained a replica in the europe-west2-a zone. Customers with replicated bigtables in europe-west2-a/b/c using Multi-Cluster routing may have seen increased latencies due to traffic failing over to other regions. The total impact duration was 19 hours, 15 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Wednesday, 20 July 2022 02:20 US/Pacific\n* **Cloud Composer:** Cloud Composer environments (data-plane side) and operations (control-plane side) experienced degraded performance in europe-west2 on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 from 09:00 to 22:30 US/Pacific. Control plane operations experienced high failure rates (failure rate reached 100% at the peak). The number of Composer environments reporting a normal, operational state dropped by ~37%. Total capacity of all environments in the region (measured by the total number of tasks being executed in the whole region) was significantly reduced and the drop reached ~50% at the peak. The total impact duration was 13 hours, 30 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 22:30 US/Pacific\n* **Cloud Data Fusion:** ~20% of Data Fusion Instances in europe-west2 experienced service degradation, ranging from logs and metrics not being updated to complete loss of availability of their instance on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 10:15 to 21:30 US/Pacific. ~5% of instances were usable during the impact duration. The total impact duration was 11 hours, 15 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 21:30 US/Pacific\n* **Cloud Datastore:** Customers may have experienced timeouts and degraded service on approximately 1% of writes in the europe-west2 Datastore instance. The total impact duration was 9 hours, 25 minutes, on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 from approximately 12:30 to 19:30 US/Pacific. Approximately 40% of customers experienced significant latency increase on query operations from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 09:45 to 12:45 US/Pacific. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 19:30 US/Pacific\n* **Cloud Dataproc:** On Tuesday, 19 July 2022, from 08:00 US/Pacific to 22:00 US/Pacific, customers experienced increased error rates in creating and scaling up clusters in europe-west2. About 24% of CREATE operations and 13% of UPDATE operations were affected. Due to a backlog of queued requests requiring manual attention, error rates for old CREATE/DELETE requests remained elevated until Thursday, 21 July 2022 16:45 US/Pacific (this did not impact availability of already-running clusters). Some Dataproc clusters that were allocated in the impacted zone were unavailable during power down. Most of these came up by 19 July 2022 22:00 US/Pacific. By this time, CREATE operations in all zones began working. A few existing clusters were impacted by the long tail recovery in Google Compute Engine and were restored when that effort completed on Thursday, 21 July 2022 02:32 US/Pacific. Primary impact duration was approximately 14 hours. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 22:00 US/Pacific\n* **Cloud Firestore:** Firestore streaming (listen, write) requests via Webchannel were 100% unavailable in the europe-west2 instance on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 from 07:15 to 09:55 US/Pacific. The total impact duration was 2 hours, 40 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 09:55 US/Pacific\n* **Cloud Secret Manager** Cloud Secret Manager experienced an outage for secrets that were exclusively stored in europe-west2 from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 07:29 to 08:46 US/Pacific. Secret Manager is a global service that lets users define in which regions to store a given secret. The regional service instances for europe-west2 were deployed in the impacted data center. The total impact duration was 1 hour, 17 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 08:46 US/Pacific\n* **Cloud Spanner:** A more comprehensive investigation into our Cloud Spanner logs indicated no evidence of any customer impact. If you were impacted, please contact Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support, and we will review your logs.\n* **Cloud SQL:** Customers experienced downtime on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 starting at 09:25 US/Pacific. 36% of zonal (non-HA) instances in europe-west2-a were affected. Additionally, 31% of regional (HA) instances whose primaries were located in europe-west2-a experienced extended downtime because they were unable to successfully fail over to another zone. Finally, customers experienced some failures during the incident for backup, instance creation, update, delete, restart, export, and Database Migration Service operations. The total impact duration was 17 hours, 30 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 21:00 US/Pacific\n* **Dataflow:** Approximately 8% of Dataflow streaming jobs running in europe-west2 were stuck from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 07:11 to 12:38 US/Pacific. There was limited impact to batch Dataflow jobs. Some new Dataflow jobs could not be initiated. The total impact duration was 5 hours, 27 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 12:38 US/Pacific\n* **Datastream:** Datastream streams experienced errors and processing lag in europe-west2-a as a result of impact on the data-plane infrastructure and services from Tuesday, 19 July 2002 09:05 to Wednesday, 20 July 2022 03:00 US/Pacific. Customers were advised to run their streams in another region. The total impact duration was 17 hours, 55 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Wednesday, 20 July 2022 03:00 US/Pacific\n* **Google App Engine, Cloud Functions, and Cloud Run:** Customers may have experienced high error rates for Google App Engine, Cloud Functions and Cloud Run in europe-west2. Customers with a multi-region architecture could failover to another region. Traffic for ~72% of projects from Cloud Tasks, Cloud Scheduler, Eventarc, Cloud Pubsub to App Engine and Cloud Functions experienced up to 18% dropped requests/events on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 07:18 to 10:05 US/Pacific. Traffic from other sources (including end-users) to ~35% of App Engine, Cloud Functions, and Cloud Run projects experienced elevated latency in the same time period. Furthermore, ~5% of Cloud Run projects experienced elevated error rates (reaching peaks of 90% unavailability) caused by new instances failing to be created (some of which were due to a dependency on Google Cloud Secret Manager). The total impact duration was: * App Engine Flexible: 13 hours, 1 minute * App Engine Standard: 3 hours, 36 minutes * Cloud Functions: 3 hours, 36 minutes * Cloud Run: 3 hours, 36 minutes ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 10:05 US/Pacific (App Engine Standard, Cloud Functions, Cloud Run) and Tuesday, 19 July 2022 20:30 US/Pacific (App Engine Flexible)\n* **Google BigQuery:** On Tuesday, 19 July 2022 between 04:40 US/Pacific and 13:43 US/Pacific, 12% of the projects in europe-west2 experienced errors and dataset unavailability. This was caused by mitigations and the power down of one of the data centers serving the europe-west2-a zone, which reduced the storage and compute capacity available to BigQuery. As a regional service, BigQuery was able to mitigate some of this capacity loss by shifting load to other data centers. However, BigQuery datasets which happened to be hosted solely in that data center were unavailable during the power down. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 13:43 US/Pacific\n* **Google Cloud Tasks:** Cloud Tasks automatically distributes projects across cloud zones within a region. 6% of projects in europe-west2 were loaded in the data center that was powered down on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 10:05 US/Pacific, and stopped delivering tasks until 13:24, after which delivery was resumed. No tasks were executed in any newly created queues in the region and in any existing queues in the impacted zone. However, as a regional service, Cloud Task was eventually able to mitigate all of the capacity loss by shifting load to other zones. The total impact duration was 3 hours, 19 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 13:24 US/Pacific\n* **Google Cloud Scheduler:** Cloud Scheduler automatically distributes projects across Cloud zones within a region. 6% of projects in europe-west2 were loaded in the datacenter that was powered down on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 10:05 US/Pacific and stopped executing jobs until 13:24, after which execution was resumed. As a regional service, Cloud Scheduler was eventually able to mitigate all of the capacity loss by shifting load to other zones. The total impact duration was 3 hours, 19 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 13:24 US/Pacific\n* **Cloud Filestore:** 45% of instances in europe-west2-a experienced service unavailability from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 10:05 US/Pacific to Wednesday, 20 July 2022 01:10 US/Pacific. This impact lasted until the mitigation time. At this point customers with working instances experienced no additional issues. 6.4% of impacted instances did not recover automatically and had to be recovered manually, which completed on Wednesday, 20 July 18:32 US/Pacific. The symptoms of these varied from unavailability to degraded availability. Customers were advised to fail over to another region, if possible. The total impact duration was 10 hours, 30 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Wednesday, 20 July 2022 01:10 US/Pacific\n* **Google Kubernetes Engine:** 15% of zonal clusters in europe-west2-a and 57% of regional & zonal cluster nodes in europe-west2-a were fully unavailable from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 from 09:30 to 21:30 US/Pacific. Regional cluster control planes remained available, but overall cluster health may have been impacted by node unavailability. Customers were encouraged to move their workloads to other regions if possible. The approximate impact duration was 12 hours. However, a few clusters experienced lag through the next day due to underlying GCE impact. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 21:30 US/Pacific\n* **Looker:** Looker instances in europe-west2 were unavailable or experienced degraded performance starting Tuesday, July 19, 2022 09:33 through Wednesday, July 20, 2022 at 05:57 US/Pacific.

        "text": "This is a preliminary Incident Report (Mini-IR). A Full Incident Report with additional details is being prepared and will be posted at a later date.\nWe apologize for the inconvenience this service disruption/outage may have caused. We would like to provide some information about this incident below. Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support .\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 2022-07-19 06:33\n**Incident End:** 2022-07-20 21:20\n**Duration:** 1 day, 14 hours, 47 minutes\n**Regions/Zones:** europe-west2\n**Description:**\nOn Tuesday, 19 July 2022, a partial cooling failure in one of the buildings that hosts the zone europe-west2-a impacted multiple Google Cloud services. This resulted in some customers experiencing service unavailability for impacted products. The cooling system impairment began at 04:30 PDT, and was fully restored at 15:28 PDT. Google engineers were engaged at 06:40 PDT after a rise in temperature was noted by automated monitoring systems, and took a number of steps to reduce thermal load in the datacenter before ultimately turning down services and powering off servers in the affected zone at 09:04 PDT due to temperature excursions. Engineering teams worked in shifts around the clock to restore services once temperatures inside the datacenter returned to acceptable levels, and inital restoration began at 14:13 PDT. Many services in the affected zone were available again by 20:24 PDT on 19 July 2022, and service restoration was complete on 20 July 2022 at 04:28 PDT. A small number of customers experienced residual effects which were fully mitigated by 21:20 PDT on 20 July 2022. Preliminary root cause has been identified as two separate chiller unit failures, coupled with high ambient weather conditions, at one of the buildings that hosts the europe-west2-a zone.\nWe sincerely apologize to our customers who were impacted by this service disruption. Google and its suppliers are conducting a detailed analysis of the cooling system failure which triggered this incident, and Google engineers will subsequently conduct an audit of cooling system equipment and standards across the data centers which house Google cloud zones, to ensure that the lessons learned from this incident are applied consistently at all locations.\n**Customer Impact:**\n* **Google Cloud Storage:** Some customers with data replicated only in the impacted region experienced HTTP 500 errors.

      "text": "## Incident Report\n**Summary:**\nOn Tuesday, 19 July 2022 at 06:33 US/Pacific, a simultaneous failure of multiple, redundant cooling systems in one of the data centers that hosts the zone europe-west2-a impacted multiple Google Cloud services. This resulted in some customers experiencing service unavailability for impacted products.\nTo our customers whose businesses were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps (detailed in the **Remediation & Prevention** section below) to improve the region's resilience.\n***Regional Impact***\nA number of regional Google Cloud services experienced impact during this incident, despite regional services being designed to survive the failure of a single zone. Upon investigation we have found two key contributing factors which led to these regional impacts: * At the start of the incident, we inadvertently modified traffic routing for internal services to avoid all three zones in the europe-west2 region, rather than just the impacted europe-west2-a zone. We corrected this on 19 July 2022 at 12:35 US/Pacific. * Our regional storage services, including GCS and BigQuery, replicate customer data across multiple zones. Due to the regional traffic routing change, they were unable to access any replica for a number of storage objects. This prevented customers from reading these objects until the traffic routing was corrected, at which point access was immediately restored.\n***Cooling System Impact Duration***\nGoogle engineers powered down the data center that hosted a portion of the impacted zone europe-west2-a on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 at 10:05 US/Pacific while the cooling system was repaired. The cooling system was repaired at 14:13 US/Pacific. The total duration of the cooling system failure impact was 4 hours, 8 minutes.\n***Cloud Service Restoration Duration***\nGoogle engineers began service restoration once the cooling system was repaired on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 at 14:13 US/Pacific. Cloud services were restored to operation by Wednesday, 20 July 2022 at 04:28 US/Pacific.\nThe duration of impact on Cloud services spans the window from 10:05 US/Pacific on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 (when a portion of europe-west2-a was powered down), to 04:28 US/Pacific on Wednesday, 20 July 2022, when Cloud services were restored; a total of 18 hours, 23 minutes.\n***Long Tail Duration***\nAfter the initial restoration of service to the zone, a small number of Google Compute Engine instances required additional work by our engineers to restore them to normal operations. This manifested as unavailable instances in GCE, and unavailable instances in products and services that rely on Google Compute Engine, such as Cloud SQL. This was fully mitigated on Wednesday, 20 July 2022 at 21:20 US/Pacific and the incident was closed with all services restored.\nFor the instances in this long tail, impact duration spans the window from the initial power down (at 10:05 US/Pacific on Tuesday, 19 July 2022) to the eventual full mitigation (at 21:20 US/Pacific on Wednesday, 20 July 2022); a total of 35 hours, 15 minutes.\nGoogle is conducting a detailed analysis of the systems and processes involved in both the cooling failure and the service recovery, with specific followup AIs identified below.\n**Root Cause:**\nOne of the data centers that hosts zone europe-west2-a could not maintain a safe operating temperature due to a simultaneous failure of multiple, redundant cooling systems combined with the extraordinarily high outside temperatures. We powered down this part of the zone to prevent an even longer outage or damage to machines. This caused a partial failure of capacity in that zone, leading to instance terminations, service degradation, and networking issues for a subset of customers.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nGoogle engineers were alerted to an issue affecting two cooling systems in one of the data centers that hosts europe-west2-a on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 at 06:33 US/Pacific and began an investigation. Engineers were engaged at 07:02 and began assessing viable mitigations. At 10:05, our engineers decided to power down servers in the impacted data center within europe-west2-a to prevent an even longer outage and further impact to infrastructure in the zone.\nThe cooling system was repaired at 14:13, and we restored our services by Wednesday, 20 July 2022, at 04:28 US/Pacific. A small subset of customers experienced residual effects which were fully mitigated by 21:20.\nGoogle is committed to preventing a future recurrence and improving recovery times by taking the following actions: * A small number of services experienced problems in zonal failover automation. We will repair and carefully re-test our failover automation to ensure stronger resilience in our failover protocols during large scale events such as this one. * We will investigate and develop more advanced methods to progressively decrease the thermal load within a single data center space, reducing the probability that a full shutdown is required. * Our initial recovery of impacted services once cooling was restored was 14 hours, 15 minutes. Additionally, the recovery of the long tail of impacted Google Compute Engine instances and related services was an additional 16 hours, 52 minutes. We are examining our procedures, tooling, and automated recovery systems for gaps to substantially improve our recovery times in the future. * Google engineers are actively conducting a detailed analysis of the cooling system failure that triggered this incident. * Google engineers will be conducting an audit of cooling system equipment and standards across the data centers that house Google Cloud globally.\n**Detailed Description of Impact:**\nOn Tuesday, 19 July 2022 from 06:33 to Wednesday, 20 July 2022 21:20 US/Pacific, some customers may have experienced high latency or errors in multiple Google Cloud services in the impacted location as detailed below:\n**Infrastructure Services**\n* **Google Compute Engine:** As data center temperatures started to increase, on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 at 08:06 US/Pacific Compute Engine terminated 42% of the Preemptible VMs (PVMs) across the europe-west2 region to reduce thermal load in zone europe-west2-a and ensure space for zonal failover activities in zones europe-west2-b and europe-west2-c. When we proceeded to power down the impacted data center to mitigate the cooling overload on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 at 10:07 US/Pacific, Compute Engine terminated all VMs in the impacted data center, representing approximately 35% of the VMs in the europe-west2-a zone. We were able to re-enable PVM launches in the running europe-west2-b and europe-west2-c zones at 13:50 US/Pacific. Power was restored on 19 July 2022 at 14:13 US/Pacific, at which point we began the recovery process for Compute Engine. To ensure a safe restoration, the team carefully sequenced the startup of the services powering Compute Engine. This process completed and the majority of VMs came back online starting at 20:18 US/Pacific. We enabled PVMs once the majority of the other VMs were running at 21:27 US/Pacific.The total impact duration was 12 hours, 12 minutes. A small number of VMs (approximately 0.6% of the europe-west2-a zone) encountered conflicts in our control plane state, requiring a manual reconciliation process. We completed this reconciliation for the “long tail” of all VMs on Thursday, 21 July 2022 at 02:32 US/Pacific. A small number of control plane requests to delete missing VMs during the incident required manual resolution, which was completed at 15:50 US/Pacific. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Thursday, 21 July 2022 20:18 US/Pacific\n* **Persistent Disk (PD):** Approximately 38% of Persistent Disk volumes in zone europe-west2-a were unavailable from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 09:13 US/Pacific. Affected customers would observe unresponsive disks or I/O errors. In most cases, the GCE instances using these volumes were terminated shortly afterward, but about 1% of the unavailable Persistent Disk volumes in zone europe-west2-a were attached to instances that remained online throughout the incident. Approximately 96% of Persistent Disk volumes recovered automatically by 20:30 US/Pacific, but the remainder required additional work to recover, which completed on Wednesday, 20 July 2022 03:10 US/Pacific. Additionally, about 11% of Regional Persistent Disk volumes in the europe-west2 region experienced high disk latency at the beginning of the incident. Most of the Regional Persistent Disk volumes successfully detected the fault in zone europe-west2-a and switched to unreplicated mode, but about 8% of Regional Persistent Disk volumes in the europe-west2 region were unable to correctly detect the fault until the Persistent Disk team forced them into unreplicated mode, which completed around 11:50 US/Pacific. About 17% of Regional Persistent Disk customers in the europe-west2 region experienced errors performing control plane operations, including creating, deleting, attaching, detaching, and snapshotting Regional Persistent Disk volumes from 19 July 2022 07:18 US/Pacific to 13:40 US/Pacific as an unintended side effect of mitigation efforts. As a result of mitigation efforts, 38% of customers were unable to create new Persistent Disk volumes in zone europe-west2-a from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 11:16 US/Pacific to 20 July 2022 02:56 US/Pacific. Additionally, 48% of customers were unable to create new Persistent Disk volumes in zones europe-west2-b and europe-west2-c from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 10:23 US/Pacific to 11:36 US/Pacific. The Persistent Disk snapshot service was unavailable for 38% of customers in zone europe-west2-a from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 from 08:11 US/Pacific to 21:29 US/Pacific. During this time, affected customers could not create new Persistent Disk snapshots from disks located in zone europe-west2-a nor restore snapshots and disk images to disks in zone europe-west2-a. The total impact duration was 12 hours, 16 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Wednesday, 20 July 2022 03:10 US/Pacific\n* **Google Cloud Storage:** On Tuesday, 19 July 2022 between 07:18 and 08:54 US/Pacific, ReadObject availability for buckets located in europe-west2 dropped to approximately 86%, and the entire region's availability to 96%. This impacted 24% of customer projects within this region. Customers would have received HTTP 500s when reading previously written data. All other operations, as well as read for new ingress, or data that was outside of the affected zones were not impacted. The total impact duration was 96 minutes. Google Cloud Storage (GCS) stores replicas in at least 2 independent colossus clusters. As a regional (not zonal) product, GCS leverages placement algorithms to ensure locations, network, and data center diversity when selecting colossus clusters [1]. There was a legacy placement algorithm isolated to just the europe-west2 region allowing for three colossus clusters in the region to be impacted by the same underlying issue relating to a single data center. In a small number of cases GCS had replicated regional data residing in two offline clusters, and subsequently some customers were unable to access and read some of their existing regional scoped data when the regional clusters were taken offline. Writes and other operations were not impacted.

Affected customers observed 5xx responses from their API Gateways. The total impact duration was 6 hours, 40 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 14:00 US/Pacific.\n* **Cloud Bigtable:** ~70% of unreplicated Bigtable instances in europe-west2-a experienced 100% data plane unavailability from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 07:05 to Wednesday, 20 July 2022 02:20 US/Pacific. We observed failed control plane operations for 11% of instances that contained a replica in the europe-west2-a zone. Customers with replicated bigtables in europe-west2-a/b/c using Multi-Cluster routing may have seen increased latencies due to traffic failing over to other regions. The total impact duration was 19 hours, 15 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Wednesday, 20 July 2022 02:20 US/Pacific\n* **Cloud Composer:** Cloud Composer environments (data-plane side) and operations (control-plane side) experienced degraded performance in europe-west2 on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 from 09:00 to 22:30 US/Pacific. Control plane operations experienced high failure rates (failure rate reached 100% at the peak). The number of Composer environments reporting a normal, operational state dropped by ~37%. Total capacity of all environments in the region (measured by the total number of tasks being executed in the whole region) was significantly reduced and the drop reached ~50% at the peak. The total impact duration was 13 hours, 30 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 22:30 US/Pacific\n* **Cloud Data Fusion:** ~20% of Data Fusion Instances in europe-west2 experienced service degradation, ranging from logs and metrics not being updated to complete loss of availability of their instance on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 10:15 to 21:30 US/Pacific. ~5% of instances were usable during the impact duration. The total impact duration was 11 hours, 15 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 21:30 US/Pacific\n* **Cloud Datastore:** Customers may have experienced timeouts and degraded service on approximately 1% of writes in the europe-west2 Datastore instance. The total impact duration was 9 hours, 25 minutes, on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 from approximately 12:30 to 19:30 US/Pacific. Approximately 40% of customers experienced significant latency increase on query operations from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 09:45 to 12:45 US/Pacific. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 19:30 US/Pacific\n* **Cloud Dataproc:** On Tuesday, 19 July 2022, from 08:00 US/Pacific to 22:00 US/Pacific, customers experienced increased error rates in creating and scaling up clusters in europe-west2. About 24% of CREATE operations and 13% of UPDATE operations were affected. Due to a backlog of queued requests requiring manual attention, error rates for old CREATE/DELETE requests remained elevated until Thursday, 21 July 2022 16:45 US/Pacific (this did not impact availability of already-running clusters). Some Dataproc clusters that were allocated in the impacted zone were unavailable during power down. Most of these came up by 19 July 2022 22:00 US/Pacific. By this time, CREATE operations in all zones began working. A few existing clusters were impacted by the long tail recovery in Google Compute Engine and were restored when that effort completed on Thursday, 21 July 2022 02:32 US/Pacific. Primary impact duration was approximately 14 hours. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 22:00 US/Pacific\n* **Cloud Firestore:** Firestore streaming (listen, write) requests via Webchannel were 100% unavailable in the europe-west2 instance on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 from 07:15 to 09:55 US/Pacific. The total impact duration was 2 hours, 40 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 09:55 US/Pacific\n* **Cloud Secret Manager** Cloud Secret Manager experienced an outage for secrets that were exclusively stored in europe-west2 from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 07:29 to 08:46 US/Pacific. Secret Manager is a global service that lets users define in which regions to store a given secret. The regional service instances for europe-west2 were deployed in the impacted data center. The total impact duration was 1 hour, 17 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 08:46 US/Pacific\n* **Cloud Spanner:** A more comprehensive investigation into our Cloud Spanner logs indicated no evidence of any customer impact. If you were impacted, please contact Google Cloud Support using https://cloud.google.com/support, and we will review your logs.\n* **Cloud SQL:** Customers experienced downtime on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 starting at 09:25 US/Pacific. 36% of zonal (non-HA) instances in europe-west2-a were affected. Additionally, 31% of regional (HA) instances whose primaries were located in europe-west2-a experienced extended downtime because they were unable to successfully fail over to another zone. Finally, customers experienced some failures during the incident for backup, instance creation, update, delete, restart, export, and Database Migration Service operations. The total impact duration was 17 hours, 30 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 21:00 US/Pacific\n* **Dataflow:** Approximately 8% of Dataflow streaming jobs running in europe-west2 were stuck from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 07:11 to 12:38 US/Pacific. There was limited impact to batch Dataflow jobs. Some new Dataflow jobs could not be initiated. The total impact duration was 5 hours, 27 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 12:38 US/Pacific\n* **Datastream:** Datastream streams experienced errors and processing lag in europe-west2-a as a result of impact on the data-plane infrastructure and services from Tuesday, 19 July 2002 09:05 to Wednesday, 20 July 2022 03:00 US/Pacific. Customers were advised to run their streams in another region. The total impact duration was 17 hours, 55 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Wednesday, 20 July 2022 03:00 US/Pacific\n* **Google App Engine, Cloud Functions, and Cloud Run:** Customers may have experienced high error rates for Google App Engine, Cloud Functions and Cloud Run in europe-west2. Customers with a multi-region architecture could failover to another region. Traffic for ~72% of projects from Cloud Tasks, Cloud Scheduler, Eventarc, Cloud Pubsub to App Engine and Cloud Functions experienced up to 18% dropped requests/events on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 07:18 to 10:05 US/Pacific. Traffic from other sources (including end-users) to ~35% of App Engine, Cloud Functions, and Cloud Run projects experienced elevated latency in the same time period. Furthermore, ~5% of Cloud Run projects experienced elevated error rates (reaching peaks of 90% unavailability) caused by new instances failing to be created (some of which were due to a dependency on Google Cloud Secret Manager). The total impact duration was: * App Engine Flexible: 13 hours, 1 minute * App Engine Standard: 3 hours, 36 minutes * Cloud Functions: 3 hours, 36 minutes * Cloud Run: 3 hours, 36 minutes ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 10:05 US/Pacific (App Engine Standard, Cloud Functions, Cloud Run) and Tuesday, 19 July 2022 20:30 US/Pacific (App Engine Flexible)\n* **Google BigQuery:** On Tuesday, 19 July 2022 between 04:40 US/Pacific and 13:43 US/Pacific, 12% of the projects in europe-west2 experienced errors and dataset unavailability. This was caused by mitigations and the power down of one of the data centers serving the europe-west2-a zone, which reduced the storage and compute capacity available to BigQuery. As a regional service, BigQuery was able to mitigate some of this capacity loss by shifting load to other data centers. However, BigQuery datasets which happened to be hosted solely in that data center were unavailable during the power down. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 13:43 US/Pacific\n* **Google Cloud Tasks:** Cloud Tasks automatically distributes projects across cloud zones within a region. 6% of projects in europe-west2 were loaded in the data center that was powered down on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 10:05 US/Pacific, and stopped delivering tasks until 13:24, after which delivery was resumed. No tasks were executed in any newly created queues in the region and in any existing queues in the impacted zone. However, as a regional service, Cloud Task was eventually able to mitigate all of the capacity loss by shifting load to other zones. The total impact duration was 3 hours, 19 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 13:24 US/Pacific\n* **Google Cloud Scheduler:** Cloud Scheduler automatically distributes projects across Cloud zones within a region. 6% of projects in europe-west2 were loaded in the datacenter that was powered down on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 10:05 US/Pacific and stopped executing jobs until 13:24, after which execution was resumed. As a regional service, Cloud Scheduler was eventually able to mitigate all of the capacity loss by shifting load to other zones. The total impact duration was 3 hours, 19 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 13:24 US/Pacific\n* **Cloud Filestore:** 45% of instances in europe-west2-a experienced service unavailability from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 10:05 US/Pacific to Wednesday, 20 July 2022 01:10 US/Pacific. This impact lasted until the mitigation time. At this point customers with working instances experienced no additional issues. 6.4% of impacted instances did not recover automatically and had to be recovered manually, which completed on Wednesday, 20 July 18:32 US/Pacific. The symptoms of these varied from unavailability to degraded availability. Customers were advised to fail over to another region, if possible. The total impact duration was 10 hours, 30 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Wednesday, 20 July 2022 01:10 US/Pacific\n* **Google Kubernetes Engine:** 15% of zonal clusters in europe-west2-a and 57% of regional & zonal cluster nodes in europe-west2-a were fully unavailable from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 from 09:30 to 21:30 US/Pacific. Regional cluster control planes remained available, but overall cluster health may have been impacted by node unavailability. Customers were encouraged to move their workloads to other regions if possible. The approximate impact duration was 12 hours. However, a few clusters experienced lag through the next day due to underlying GCE impact. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 21:30 US/Pacific\n* **Looker:** Looker instances in europe-west2 were unavailable or experienced degraded performance starting Tuesday, July 19, 2022 09:33 through Wednesday, July 20, 2022 at 05:57 US/Pacific. Once temperatures inside the data center returned to safe levels, the Looker team restored file systems for impacted customers, and all Looker instances were back online on Wednesday, July 20, 2022 at 05:57 US/Pacific. The total impact duration was 20 hours, 24 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Wednesday, 20 July 2022 05:57 US/Pacific\n* **Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory:** 28.57% of the Managed Active Directory domains configured in the europe-west2 region were impacted during the incident. Starting July 19, 2022 09:20:00 US/Pacific, the impacted customers had one less domain controller (DC) serving incoming traffic. However, the domains continued to operate with reduced redundancy. Furthermore, periodic backups (12h frequency) were not performed for the impacted domains during the incident window. Subsequent backups were successful. The total impact duration was 12 hours, 30 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 21:50 US/Pacific\n* **Memorystore for Memcached:** 20.8% of instances in europe-west2 experienced degraded performance and availability issues resulting in a total cache flush. Impact start was Tuesday 19 July at 09:35 US/Pacific.All instances with VMs in europe-west2-a were unavailable or performed with degraded performance for the entire duration of the event. Instances that were only located in europe-west2-a were unavailable. Instances with some VMs in europe-west2-a lost their corresponding memcache availability (storage/access).All affected instances experienced a cache flush. DELETE, and RECREATE operations were unavailable for instances located in europe-west2-a. CREATE operations were not affected. UPDATE was not affected as there were no requests during that time but was theoretically unavailable. The total impact duration was 1 day, 5 hours, 27 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Wednesday, 20 July 2022 15:02 US/Pacific\n* **Memorystore for Redis:** ~10% of instances in europe-west2 experienced timeouts with the management API (create, update, delete, etc) from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 09:24 to Wednesday, 20 July 2022 21:19 US/Pacific. Customers whose instances are located in the affected data center in the europe-west2-a zone were unable to access their instances. Additionally, all affected instances experienced a cache flush. In total, ~39% of basic-tier instances in europe-west2-a were affected. The total impact duration was 11 hours, 11 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Wednesday, 20 July 2022 21:19 US/Pacific\n* **Vertex AI online prediction:** Vertex AI prediction showed an elevated error rate on Tuesday, 19 July 2022 from 10:00 to 15:11 US/Pacific for a total impact duration of 5 hours 11 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 15:11 US/Pacific\n* **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):** Approximately 35% of the VMs in the europe-west2-a zone were unreachable from Tuesday, 19 July 2022 10:06 US/ Pacific to 20:32 US/ Pacific. This includes all Cloud traffic into and out of 1275 / 3509 VMs in europe-west2-a . Both the control plane and the data plane were impacted. The total impact duration was 10 hours, 26 minutes. ***Impact Mitigation time:*** Tuesday, 19 July 2022 20:32 US/Pacific\n-------------------------",

        "text": "## INCIDENT REPORT\n**Summary:**\nGoogle Cloud Networking experienced reduced capacity for lower priority traffic such as batch, streaming and transfer operations from 19:30 US/Pacific on Thursday, 14 July 2022, through 15:02 US/Pacific on Friday, 15 July 2022. High-priority user-facing traffic was not affected. This service disruption resulted from an issue encountered during a combination of repair work and a routine network software upgrade rollout. Due to the nature of the disruption and resilience capabilities of Google Cloud products, the impacted regions and individual impact windows varied substantially. To our customers whose businesses were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s availability.\n**Root Cause:**\nThe root cause was identified as an issue with a new control plane configuration rollout, causing low-priority classified traffic capacity reduction in Google’s internal backbone network connecting data centers. Mitigation efforts were slowed by the capacity reduction, and engineering teams required more than their usual time to safely undo the configuration change. During the period of the rollout and subsequent rollback, constrained traffic in certain cloud zones affected the performance of some Cloud services.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nAt approximately 02:00 US/Pacific on Friday, 15 July, as an in-progress rollout expanded to more regions, Google engineers observed performance degradation in Cloud Networking due to reduced capacity. The engineering team then started an investigation into the cause. At 03:50 US/Pacific, Google engineers pushed the first mitigation attempt to halt the ongoing rollout. While this effort succeeded in pausing any new actions, those already in progress continued, which further reduced network capacity.\nSubsequently, the engineering team shifted their mitigation efforts toward a global rollback of the problematic configuration. Their first attempt to mitigate using a configuration push was applied at 08:40 US/Pacific, but it was not successfully applied to all nodes, due in part to the reduced network performance.

      "text": "## INCIDENT REPORT\n**Summary:**\nGoogle Cloud Networking experienced reduced capacity for lower priority traffic such as batch, streaming and transfer operations from 19:30 US/Pacific on Thursday, 14 July 2022, through 15:02 US/Pacific on Friday, 15 July 2022. High-priority user-facing traffic was not affected. This service disruption resulted from an issue encountered during a combination of repair work and a routine network software upgrade rollout. Due to the nature of the disruption and resilience capabilities of Google Cloud products, the impacted regions and individual impact windows varied substantially. To our customers whose businesses were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s availability.\n**Root Cause:**\nThe root cause was identified as an issue with a new control plane configuration rollout, causing low-priority classified traffic capacity reduction in Google’s internal backbone network connecting data centers. Mitigation efforts were slowed by the capacity reduction, and engineering teams required more than their usual time to safely undo the configuration change. During the period of the rollout and subsequent rollback, constrained traffic in certain cloud zones affected the performance of some Cloud services.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nAt approximately 02:00 US/Pacific on Friday, 15 July, as an in-progress rollout expanded to more regions, Google engineers observed performance degradation in Cloud Networking due to reduced capacity. The engineering team then started an investigation into the cause. At 03:50 US/Pacific, Google engineers pushed the first mitigation attempt to halt the ongoing rollout. While this effort succeeded in pausing any new actions, those already in progress continued, which further reduced network capacity.\nSubsequently, the engineering team shifted their mitigation efforts toward a global rollback of the problematic configuration. Their first attempt to mitigate using a configuration push was applied at 08:40 US/Pacific, but it was not successfully applied to all nodes, due in part to the reduced network performance. Google engineers worked through alternate mitigations, and by 12:40 US/Pacific, the configuration was updated correctly, and this mitigated the majority of impact.\nBy 15:02 US/Pacific on 15 July 2022, services for all customers had been restored.

      "text": "INCIDENT REPORT\n**Summary:**\nGoogle Cloud Networking experienced reduced capacity for lower priority traffic such as batch, streaming and transfer operations from 19:30 US/Pacific on Thursday, 14 July 2022, through 15:02 US/Pacific on Friday, 15 July 2022. High-priority user-facing traffic was not affected. This service disruption resulted from an issue encountered during a combination of repair work and a routine network software upgrade rollout. Due to the nature of the disruption and resilience capabilities of Google Cloud products, the impacted regions and individual impact windows varied substantially. To our customers whose businesses were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s availability.\n**Root Cause:**\nThe root cause was identified as an issue with a new control plane configuration rollout, causing low-priority classified traffic capacity reduction in Google’s internal backbone network connecting data centers. Mitigation efforts were slowed by the capacity reduction, and engineering teams required more than their usual time to safely undo the configuration change. During the period of the rollout and subsequent rollback, constrained traffic in certain cloud zones affected the performance of some Cloud services.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nAt approximately 02:00 US/Pacific on Friday, 15 July, as an in-progress rollout expanded to more regions, Google engineers observed performance degradation in Cloud Networking due to reduced capacity. The engineering team then started an investigation into the cause. At 03:50 US/Pacific, Google engineers pushed the first mitigation attempt to halt the ongoing rollout. While this effort succeeded in pausing any new actions, those already in progress continued, which further reduced network capacity.\nSubsequently, the engineering team shifted their mitigation efforts toward a global rollback of the problematic configuration. Their first attempt to mitigate using a configuration push was applied at 08:40 US/Pacific, but it was not successfully applied to all nodes, due in part to the reduced network performance. Google engineers worked through alternate mitigations, and by 12:40 US/Pacific, the configuration was updated correctly, and this mitigated the majority of impact.\nBy 15:02 US/Pacific on 15 July 2022, services for all customers had been restored. The Google Cloud Service Health Dashboard was updated to reflect this.\nGoogle is committed to preventing future recurrence, and we are taking the following\nactions:\nDetection:\n* Improve signals to detect significant changes in traffic for upgraded domains in the backbone network.\n* Improve dashboards that help debugging global- and domain-level control failures and configuration status.\nPrevention:\n* Improve the automated handling of disconnected local Software Defined Networking (SDN) controllers that will reduce overall impact and mitigation time. .\n* Improve the global safety systems that globally halt elective rollouts on Google’s wide area (WAN) networks, when global capacity is reduced.\n* Further isolate production network neighborhoods.\nMitigation:\n* Improve the API to push changes to global and local network controllers during a service disruption.\n* Improve failure domain configuration validation to reject unintended configuration.\n* Improve the feature and testing of emergency tools across different scenarios at regular intervals, and invest in test environments that enable us to do this without impact.\n**Detailed Description of Impact:**\n**Google Cloud Networking**\n* Google Cloud Networking experienced reduced capacity within the Google Cloud regions of us-east1, southamerica-west1, us-central1, and us-central2, starting from Friday 15 July 2022 02:24 US/Pacific. The most severe impact occurred from 03:58 to 12:40.\n* southamerica-west1 experienced reduced capacity between 14:40 and 15:02.\n* southamerica-west1 and southamerica-east1 both experienced egress packet loss between 20% and 30%.\n**Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**\n* Between Thursday, 14 July 2022 21:57 US/Pacific and Friday, 15 July 12:40 US/Pacific, GCS customers may have experienced elevated latency, delays, issues importing, exporting or querying data from GCS buckets, and HTTP 500 errors in the Google Cloud regions of us-east1, southamerica-west1, and us-central2, and for buckets located in us-central1, us-east1, and nam4.\n* This disruption affected 0.007% of GCS requests and impacted customers reading/writing data and metadata.\n**Google BigQuery**\n* Customer workloads running in impacted Google Cloud regions and using the BigQuery Storage Read and Write APIs to read from or write to BigQuery may have experienced elevated latency.\n**Note**\n* Additional services may have been impacted by this event but did not meet the thresholds to be included in this report.",

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Support by opening a case https://cloud.google.com/support or help article https://support.google.com/a/answer/1047213.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 16 June 2022 01:11\n**Incident End:** 16 June 2022 02:44\n**Duration:** 1 hour, 33 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\n- Google Cloud Networking\n- Cloud Monitoring\n- Cloud NAT\n- Hybrid Connectivity\n- Cloud Run\n- Cloud Interconnect\n- Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)\n- Gmail\n- Cloud Bigtable\n**Regions/Zones:** Europe and Asia\n**Description:**\nGoogle Cloud Networking experienced elevated packet loss and latency with Google Cloud Services across Europe and Asia for a duration of 1 hour, 36 minutes. Any service that uses Cloud Networking may have observed impact. We have included available details of service specific impact below; however, this may not be a comprehensive accounting of all downstream networking impact.\nFrom preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was due to a large reconvergence event on our user facing backbone, which was triggered by a typical fiber cut in North America. The failure resulted in packet loss due to either some MPLS tunnels going down, or due to congestion on remaining tunnels that quickly grew to accommodate demand on next-best paths. Tunnels going down is not expected behavior of MPLS control plane in response to best-path capacity going down when adjacent capacity remains available and is being investigated with highest priority with the hardware vendor. Mitigation of the packet loss required Google engineers to manually intervene on the network control plane. The underlying Cloud Networking impact ended at 02:58, however, some Cloud Services may have taken longer to recover.\nDue to backbone control plane behavior during this event, network forwarding may have been suboptimal for some destinations resulting in higher network latency.\n**Customer Impact:**\n- **Google Cloud Networking** - Public IP traffic connectivity failed from 01:22 to 02:58 US/Pacific.\n- **Cloud Monitoring** - Affected customers observed metric data failing to publish in europe-north1.\n- **Cloud NAT** - Affected customers experienced packet loss on some flows between regions in Europe, South America, and North America.\n- **Hybrid Connectivity** - Affected customers experienced packet loss on some flows between regions in Europe, South America, and North America.\n- **Cloud Run** - Affected customers experienced packet loss in europe-north1.\n- **Cloud Interconnect** - Affected customers experienced packet loss on some flows between regions in Europe, South America, and North America.\n- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** - Affected customers experienced up to 100% packet loss with traffic between Europe and Asia over private and public IP.\n- **Cloud Bigtable** - Affected customers experienced elevated latency with read and write operations in europe-north1.\n- **Gmail** - Affected web client users experienced transient service unavailability.\n**Additional details:**\nFiber cuts on the Google network are quite common with no observable malfunction to the MPLS control plane. This incident surfaces a novel MPLS control plane behavior. We are committed to fully identifying the root cause and addressing it to prevent it with our partners.",

        "text": "# Incident Report\n**Summary:**\nOn Tuesday, 14 June 2022, at approximately 06:00 US/Pacific, Google Cloud Networking in us-central1 began experiencing increased delays in applying administrative operations, impacting several downstream services. Customers performing administrative actions on resources in us-central1 experienced delays, connectivity issues, and elevated rates of failure.\nTo our customers that were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. We are conducting an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve our service.\n**Background:**\nGoogle’s Cloud Load Balancer (GCLB) is a collection of software and services that load balances HTTP traffic across customer services. A key component of GCLB is the Google Front End (GFE), which load balances traffic over customer backend instances. GCLB also includes a health checking service to determine whether backends such as customer virtual machines, are responding to traffic as expected, or are unhealthy and should be removed from service.\n**Root Cause:**\nThe health checking service and GFE share a common resource pool. For a period of time, GCLB traffic was directed away from certain clusters, and, independently, during this time, health checking load in these clusters increased significantly.\nThe incident was triggered when Google engineers rerouted traffic to these clusters as part of a standard maintenance activity. This rerouted traffic increased load in those clusters, and this slowed the performance of the health checking service, resulting in an increasing rate of health check failures. This in turn led to a general networking control plane slowdown, as the service struggled to keep up with erroneous and rapid health status changes of load balancer backends. The slowdown in the networking control plane resulted in the impact on administrative operations for other resource types which involve network configuration. Customers may have experienced this as slowness or timeouts in administrative operations for the resource types listed in the Impact section, or delays in new resources (like VM instances) connecting to networks.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nOn Monday, 13 June 2022, at 16:30 US/Pacific, Google engineers rerouted traffic to additional compute resources in the us-central1 region as part of a standard maintenance activity.\nGoogle engineers were alerted to control plane slowness on Tuesday, 14 June 2022, at 09:17 and started an investigation. Initially, Google engineers were unable to determine the severity of the latency, due to insufficient monitoring. After attempts to mitigate by adding resources were unsuccessful, the incident was escalated at 15:50. A cross team effort of Google engineers was launched and at 17:39 mitigated the incident by removing the earlier reroute. This reduced the load on the health check system, and subsequently the networking control plane recovered at 17:43.\nGoogle is committed to improving our service in the future and will be completing the following actions:\n- Prevent similar incidents by improving the capacity modeling of our health checking service, and implementing improved resource isolation in our health checking service.\n- Detect similar incidents more rapidly by improving alerting related to the health checking process to notify responsible teams earlier and speed time to mitigate.\n- Add defense in depth: protect the downstream networking control plane from high rates of load balancing health reports, thus avoiding this type of incident in future.\n**Detailed Description of Impact:**\nOn 13 June 16:30 to 14 June 17:43 2022 US/Pacific:\n## Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)\nAffected customers would have observed latency and up to ~40% elevated errors or timeouts during GKE Private Service Connect cluster operations including creation, deletion, and updates for a subset of clusters in us-central1. ## Google Cloud Load Balancing (GCLB)\nCustomers with resources in us-central1-c and us-central1-f would have observed increased latency or timeouts and connection errors from the Load Balancer service for resources in us-central1. Customers would have seen up to a 4.5% overall error rate, with up to 23% of requests timing out. ## Filestore\nAffected customers would have observed new instance creation failures for ~50% of the outage duration. In addition, existing instances would have been running at reduced capacity as some of their nodes may have been incorrectly marked down. ## Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)\nIncreased latency and timeouts for creating and updating networking resources in us-central1.",

Any user with the compute.vmExternalIpAccess policy could not create or edit instances without a public IP.\nA bug was identified where customers with a policy restricting external IP addresses were not able to select one during instance creation. An attempt to fix this bug created a regression where changing any field in the Edit instance page would change the IP address to ephemeral for instances that had no IP address selected. Because of the org policy blocks assigning the instance a public IP, the save operation would fail.The release containing this change included a fix to address the bug however, once in production several customers reported issues.\n**REMEDIATION AND PREVENTION:**\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue via customer support case on Thursday, 16 June 2022 at 04:15 and started an investigation. At 06:11, Google engineers were able to reproduce the issue and escalated the incident at 09:08. At 09:50, Google engineers initiated a bug of the release which was completed at 11:33 fully mitigating the issue.\nGoogle is committed to improving our service in the future and will be completing the following actions:\n- Improve unit testing for org policies to identify issues of this type.\n- Improve alerting to quickly detect configuration failures.\n**DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF IMPACT:**\nOn Tuesday, 14 June 2022 03:06 to Thursday 16 June 11:33 US/Pacific\n# Google Compute Engine\nAffected customers experienced failures creating or editing GCE instances via the Google Cloud Console and may have received an error “Constraint constraints/compute.vmExternalIpAccess violated for project [project ID].“\n**ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR CUSTOMERS:**\nAs a workaround, customers were still able to create or edit GCE instances via the gcloud CLI or via Google Cloud Console by disabling the constraints/compute.vmExternalIpAccess policy.",

      "text": "**SUMMARY:**\nOn Tuesday, 14 June 2022, customers were unable to create or edit Google Compute Engine (GCE) instances via the Google Cloud Console for 2 days, 8 hours, 27 minutes. To our customers that were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. We are conducting an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve our service.\n**ROOT CAUSE:**\nCustomers can specify organization policies to limit what instances can use external IP addresses (compute.vmExternalIpAccess). Setting an IP address on an instance not allowed by policy will cause an operation failure.\nThe incident was triggered by a compute frontend UI release which made it impossible for certain users to modify instances due to interactions between org policies and a bug that forced an Ephemeral IP address while on either the edit or create page. Any user with the compute.vmExternalIpAccess policy could not create or edit instances without a public IP.\nA bug was identified where customers with a policy restricting external IP addresses were not able to select one during instance creation. An attempt to fix this bug created a regression where changing any field in the Edit instance page would change the IP address to ephemeral for instances that had no IP address selected. Because of the org policy blocks assigning the instance a public IP, the save operation would fail.The release containing this change included a fix to address the bug however, once in production several customers reported issues.\n**REMEDIATION AND PREVENTION:**\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue via customer support case on Thursday, 16 June 2022 at 04:15 and started an investigation. At 06:11, Google engineers were able to reproduce the issue and escalated the incident at 09:08. At 09:50, Google engineers initiated a bug of the release which was completed at 11:33 fully mitigating the issue.\nGoogle is committed to improving our service in the future and will be completing the following actions:\n- Improve unit testing for org policies to identify issues of this type.\n- Improve alerting to quickly detect configuration failures.\n**DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF IMPACT:**\nOn Tuesday, 14 June 2022 03:06 to Thursday 16 June 11:33 US/Pacific\n# Google Compute Engine\nAffected customers experienced failures creating or editing GCE instances via the Google Cloud Console and may have received an error “Constraint constraints/compute.vmExternalIpAccess violated for project [project ID].“\n**ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR CUSTOMERS:**\nAs a workaround, customers were still able to create or edit GCE instances via the gcloud CLI or via Google Cloud Console by disabling the constraints/compute.vmExternalIpAccess policy.",

We are conducting an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve our service.\n**Root Cause:**\nThe outage was triggered by two simultaneous fiber cuts within our Middle East network. This affected the end-to-end path for several submarine cables, reducing capacity for many telecom and technology companies, including Google.\nThe reduced capacity increased latency and caused packet loss between Google regions in Europe and regions in the Middle East and the rest of Asia.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nGoogle Engineers were alerted to the network bandwidth drop on Tuesday, 7 June 2022 at 06:00 US/Pacific. Google Engineers immediately started to redirect Internet egress demand away from the region. At 07:02, Europe-Asia traffic was redirected across backup circuits via America, trading increased latency for lower packet loss. Fiber engineers restored interim capacity by 08:26, ending packet loss between Europe and the Middle East. Once final stability was confirmed, Europe-Asia traffic was moved back to the direct path at 09:02.\nGoogle is committed to improving our service in the future and will be completing the following actions:\n- We are increasing the resilience of terrestrial network paths to provide more resilience to dual failures.\n- We are continuing with our planned programme of additional investments in the Europe-Middle East network to offer alternative network paths.\n- We are improving the effectiveness of tooling to reduce Internet egress demand during capacity shortfalls.\n**Detailed Description of Impact:**\nOn 07 June 2022 05:50 from 05:50 to 09:03 US/Pacific: ## Cloud Load Balancing\nCustomers using Cloud Load Balancing would have experienced increased packet loss up to 60% for egress traffic from Google to the Middle East and increased network latency between our Europe and Asia regions. ## Cloud Interconnect\nCloud Interconnect customers peering in the Middle East region would have experienced packet loss up to 80% during the incident. ## Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)\nCustomers using Virtual Private Cloud requiring cross-regional traffic between the following regions would have experienced packet loss of up to 50% between 05:47 and 07:03, then elevated network latency until 09:03:\n- asia-east1 to europe-southwest1, europe-west6, and europe-west8;\n- asia-east2 to all regions in Europe;\n- asia-south1 and asia-south2 to all regions in Europe, all northamerica-northeast and northamerica-southeast, and all us-east regions;\n- asia-southeast1 and asia-southeast2 to all regions in Europe;\n- australia-southeast2 to europe-west8.\n## Other Services\nWhile not specifically called out, all Google Cloud Services in the Middle East and our Europe and Asia regions could have been affected by the packet loss for egress traffic from Google to the Middle East, as well as increased latency between our Europe and Asia regions. We have listed the major services that our telemetry identified as causing customer impact.",

      "text": "# INCIDENT REPORT\n**Summary:**\nOn Tuesday, 7 June 2022, Google Cloud Networking experienced increased packet loss for egress traffic from Google to users and customers in the Middle East and elevated latency between our Europe and Asia Regions for 3 hours and 12 minutes, affecting several Cloud Networking products.\nTo our customers that were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. We are conducting an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve our service.\n**Root Cause:**\nThe outage was triggered by two simultaneous fiber cuts within our Middle East network. This affected the end-to-end path for several submarine cables, reducing capacity for many telecom and technology companies, including Google.\nThe reduced capacity increased latency and caused packet loss between Google regions in Europe and regions in the Middle East and the rest of Asia.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nGoogle Engineers were alerted to the network bandwidth drop on Tuesday, 7 June 2022 at 06:00 US/Pacific. Google Engineers immediately started to redirect Internet egress demand away from the region. At 07:02, Europe-Asia traffic was redirected across backup circuits via America, trading increased latency for lower packet loss. Fiber engineers restored interim capacity by 08:26, ending packet loss between Europe and the Middle East. Once final stability was confirmed, Europe-Asia traffic was moved back to the direct path at 09:02.\nGoogle is committed to improving our service in the future and will be completing the following actions:\n- We are increasing the resilience of terrestrial network paths to provide more resilience to dual failures.\n- We are continuing with our planned programme of additional investments in the Europe-Middle East network to offer alternative network paths.\n- We are improving the effectiveness of tooling to reduce Internet egress demand during capacity shortfalls.\n**Detailed Description of Impact:**\nOn 07 June 2022 05:50 from 05:50 to 09:03 US/Pacific: ## Cloud Load Balancing\nCustomers using Cloud Load Balancing would have experienced increased packet loss up to 60% for egress traffic from Google to the Middle East and increased network latency between our Europe and Asia regions. ## Cloud Interconnect\nCloud Interconnect customers peering in the Middle East region would have experienced packet loss up to 80% during the incident. ## Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)\nCustomers using Virtual Private Cloud requiring cross-regional traffic between the following regions would have experienced packet loss of up to 50% between 05:47 and 07:03, then elevated network latency until 09:03:\n- asia-east1 to europe-southwest1, europe-west6, and europe-west8;\n- asia-east2 to all regions in Europe;\n- asia-south1 and asia-south2 to all regions in Europe, all northamerica-northeast and northamerica-southeast, and all us-east regions;\n- asia-southeast1 and asia-southeast2 to all regions in Europe;\n- australia-southeast2 to europe-west8.\n## Other Services\nWhile not specifically called out, all Google Cloud Services in the Middle East and our Europe and Asia regions could have been affected by the packet loss for egress traffic from Google to the Middle East, as well as increased latency between our Europe and Asia regions. We have listed the major services that our telemetry identified as causing customer impact.",

The issues were triggered by high memory consumption on the file storage system in the Google Cloud distributed storage infrastructure [1] within us-east1-c. These issues were predominantly isolated to us-east1-c for zonal services, but some regional services experienced degradation until their traffic was redirected away from the impacted zone.\n[1] - https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/storage-data-transfer/a-peek-behind-colossus-googles-file-system\n**Customer Impact:**\n- **BigQuery :** Customers would have experienced failures or slowness in their requests in the us-east1 region.\n- **Cloud Dataflow:** Customers would have experienced slow or stuck jobs in us-east1.\n- **App Engine:** Customers would have experienced brief periods of unavailability.\n- **Cloud Tasks:** Customers would have experienced elevated latencies with task delivery in us-east1.\n- **Cloud Pub/Sub:** Customers would have experienced elevated error rate for Pub/Sub operations in us-east1.\n- **Persistent Disk:** Customers would have experienced slow or stuck disk reads in the us-east1-c zone leading to unresponsive instances. A small number of Regional Persistent Disk volumes experienced slow disk reads in the us-east1 region.\n- **Cloud Bigtable:** Customers would have experienced elevated latency or errors in the us-east1-c zone.\n- **Cloud Run:** A small number of customers in us-east1 would have experienced brief periods of unavailability.\n- **Google Compute Engine:** Customers would have experienced elevated latencies during instance creation or deletion operations in us-east1 and us-east4.\n- **Google Cloud Networking:** Customers would have experienced delays in connecting to newly created instances or delays in propagation of new changes to firewall programming in us-east1. Network traffic for existing instances was not affected. Customers would have also experienced delays in Cloud Load Balancing creation or modification.\n- **Cloud Functions:** Customers would have experienced elevated availability issues in us-east1.\n- **Cloud Composer:** Customers would have experienced failure with new cloud composer creations in us-east1 and us-east4 . Existing cloud composer environments were not affected.\n- **Cloud Datastore:** Customers would have experienced elevated query latencies in us-east1.",

Please see the additional details below for product specific workarounds where available:\n- Dataflow: If feasible, customers can consider restarting jobs again. They should be restarted in an unimpacted zone.\n- Persistent Disk: Use a different zone or PD-SSD disks.\n- Cloud Networking: If you are using load balancers or HA configuration, failover away from us-east1-c",

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Support by opening a case at https://cloud.google.com/support.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 04 June 2022 10:47\n**Incident End:** 04 June 2022 17:03\n**Duration:** 6 hours 16 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nMultiple Google Cloud Services\n**Regions/Zones:** us-east1-c\n**Description:**\nDue to elevated latencies, several Google Cloud Products experienced increased error rates for a period of 3 hrs 04 minutes. The issues were triggered by high memory consumption on the file storage system in the Google Cloud distributed storage infrastructure [1] within us-east1-c. These issues were predominantly isolated to us-east1-c for zonal services, but some regional services experienced degradation until their traffic was redirected away from the impacted zone.\n[1] - https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/storage-data-transfer/a-peek-behind-colossus-googles-file-system\n**Customer Impact:**\n- **BigQuery :** Customers would have experienced failures or slowness in their requests in the us-east1 region.\n- **Cloud Dataflow:** Customers would have experienced slow or stuck jobs in us-east1.\n- **App Engine:** Customers would have experienced brief periods of unavailability.\n- **Cloud Tasks:** Customers would have experienced elevated latencies with task delivery in us-east1.\n- **Cloud Pub/Sub:** Customers would have experienced elevated error rate for Pub/Sub operations in us-east1.\n- **Persistent Disk:** Customers would have experienced slow or stuck disk reads in the us-east1-c zone leading to unresponsive instances. A small number of Regional Persistent Disk volumes experienced slow disk reads in the us-east1 region.\n- **Cloud Bigtable:** Customers would have experienced elevated latency or errors in the us-east1-c zone.\n- **Cloud Run:** A small number of customers in us-east1 would have experienced brief periods of unavailability.\n- **Google Compute Engine:** Customers would have experienced elevated latencies during instance creation or deletion operations in us-east1 and us-east4.\n- **Google Cloud Networking:** Customers would have experienced delays in connecting to newly created instances or delays in propagation of new changes to firewall programming in us-east1. Network traffic for existing instances was not affected. Customers would have also experienced delays in Cloud Load Balancing creation or modification.\n- **Cloud Functions:** Customers would have experienced elevated availability issues in us-east1.\n- **Cloud Composer:** Customers would have experienced failure with new cloud composer creations in us-east1 and us-east4 . Existing cloud composer environments were not affected.\n- **Cloud Datastore:** Customers would have experienced elevated query latencies in us-east1.",

If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Support by opening a case https://cloud.google.com/support or help article https://support.google.com/a/answer/1047213.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 02 June 2022 10:10 US/Pacific\n**Incident End:** 02 June 2022 14:30 US/Pacific\n**Duration:** 4 hours, 20 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:** Vertex AI Online Prediction\n**Regions/Zones:** Global\n**Description:**\nVertex AI Online Prediction experienced increased error rates from 30% up to 100% per region depending on user usage patterns for a duration of 4 hours, 20 minutes. From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was that Vertex Prediction Endpoints were globally marked as deleted due to faulty resource cleanup process. The service fully recovered when the Vertex Prediction Endpoints were restored.\n**Customer Impact:**\nAffected customers may have experienced:\n- All pre-existing Vertex models undeployed on Vertex AI Endpoints\n- Empty responses when listing the deployed models\n- Runtime exceptions and general errors on Predict and Explain requests\n- Quota failure when trying to re-deploy models",

From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was that Vertex Prediction Endpoints were globally marked as deleted due to faulty resource cleanup process. The service fully recovered when the Vertex Prediction Endpoints were restored.\n**Customer Impact:**\nAffected customers may have experienced:\n- All pre-existing Vertex models undeployed on Vertex AI Endpoints\n- Empty responses when listing the deployed models\n- Runtime exceptions and general errors on Predict and Explain requests\n- Quota failure when trying to re-deploy models",

        "text": "**INCIDENT REPORT**\n**Summary:**\nOn 24 May 2022 from 18:04 to 25 May 2022 10:34 Google BigQuery experienced elevated query latencies and job failures in four regions (US multiregion, europe-west1, asia-east1, and asia-east2) for a duration of 16 hours, 30 minutes. A product change roll out was identified as the root cause. The issue was mitigated by rolling back the changes. The rollback was performed in phases to prevent additional impact on the service, which caused some regions to recover earlier than others. Affected customers experienced elevated latencies or failures for QUERY, IMPORT and EXPORT jobs in BigQuery.\n**Root Cause:**\nOn 11 May 2022, BigQuery began a software rollout to improve audit logging for data that is imported from, queried, or exported to Google Cloud Storage (GCS). This rollout inadvertently contained a memory leak that gradually and incrementally manifested whenever these code paths were executed. This memory leak gradually consumed memory on BigQuery’s compute nodes until they were unable to accept new work to execute jobs, including queries, loads, and exports. The software rollout was deployed to all regions before the issue was detected and rolled back. Given the nature of the root cause, significant user load and time were required for the issue to manifest, meaning that the issue was not observed in internal testing, or in most of BigQuery's production regions.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nBigQuery will take the following actions to mitigate against such issues happening in the future: - In the short-term, enable comprehensive memory error detector coverage for the affected code path to detect possible memory leaks ahead of time. - In the long-term, ensure such analysis is enabled for all BigQuery code paths.\nIntroduce additional internal monitoring to detect memory pressure scenarios.\n**Detailed Description of Impact**\nIn affected regions, a portion of BigQuery compute nodes were unable to service incoming jobs due to insufficient memory. As a result customer jobs - including queries, loads, and exports - experienced elevated latencies and failures while waiting for nodes with sufficient memory to become available.",

From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue is a product change which had been rolled out globally. The issue was mitigated by rolling back the changes. The rollback was performed in a phased manner to prevent additional impact on the service and some regions would have recovered earlier than others.\n**Customer Impact:**\n* Affected customers would have experienced elevated query latencies or in some cases query failures.",

      "text": "**INCIDENT REPORT**\n**Summary:**\nOn 24 May 2022 from 18:04 to 25 May 2022 10:34 Google BigQuery experienced elevated query latencies and job failures in four regions (US multiregion, europe-west1, asia-east1, and asia-east2) for a duration of 16 hours, 30 minutes. A product change roll out was identified as the root cause. The issue was mitigated by rolling back the changes. The rollback was performed in phases to prevent additional impact on the service, which caused some regions to recover earlier than others. Affected customers experienced elevated latencies or failures for QUERY, IMPORT and EXPORT jobs in BigQuery.\n**Root Cause:**\nOn 11 May 2022, BigQuery began a software rollout to improve audit logging for data that is imported from, queried, or exported to Google Cloud Storage (GCS). This rollout inadvertently contained a memory leak that gradually and incrementally manifested whenever these code paths were executed. This memory leak gradually consumed memory on BigQuery’s compute nodes until they were unable to accept new work to execute jobs, including queries, loads, and exports. The software rollout was deployed to all regions before the issue was detected and rolled back. Given the nature of the root cause, significant user load and time were required for the issue to manifest, meaning that the issue was not observed in internal testing, or in most of BigQuery's production regions.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nBigQuery will take the following actions to mitigate against such issues happening in the future: - In the short-term, enable comprehensive memory error detector coverage for the affected code path to detect possible memory leaks ahead of time. - In the long-term, ensure such analysis is enabled for all BigQuery code paths.\nIntroduce additional internal monitoring to detect memory pressure scenarios.\n**Detailed Description of Impact**\nIn affected regions, a portion of BigQuery compute nodes were unable to service incoming jobs due to insufficient memory. As a result customer jobs - including queries, loads, and exports - experienced elevated latencies and failures while waiting for nodes with sufficient memory to become available.",

The issue was identified and mitigated automatically by 14:07 US/Pacific.\nWe understand this issue has affected our valued customers and users, and we apologize to those who were affected.\n**ROOT CAUSE:**\nGoogle’s production backbone is a global network that enables connectivity for all user-facing traffic via Points of Presence (POPs) or internet exchanges.\nA failure of a component on a fiber path from one of the central US gateway campuses in Google’s production backbone led to a decrease in available network bandwidth between the gateway and multiple edge locations, causing packet loss while the backbone automatically moved traffic onto remaining paths.\nThe network topology in this region is being augmented, and the second-best path has not completed its augmentation. This meant some traffic needed to reroute onto the third-best path, which led to an extended traffic migration period. This disruption was more severe than we had anticipated, and is the subject of remediation actions below.\n**REMEDIATION AND PREVENTION:**\nGoogle’s automated repair mechanisms detected the decrease in available network bandwidth on Friday, 20 May 2022 at 13:47 US/Pacific and automatically routed the traffic through alternate links. The traffic rerouting completed on Friday, 20 May 2022 at 14:06 US/Pacific, mitigating the issue.\nWhile our automated mechanisms worked as intended and recovered the traffic without manual intervention, we understand that the scope of impact caused by this event affected our customers.\nWe have been working on optimizing our global network to minimize the time spent automatically reconfiguring around failures like this (known as \"convergence time\"). While we have made progress, efforts to improve are ongoing. We continue to ensure that the current technology is optimally configured to minimize the frequency and severity of these issues.\nIn this network region, we intend to complete the augmentation by 11 July 2022, which will return the network to the intended topology where any single fiber path failure can be rerouted quickly onto the second-best path.\nWe will also build automatic analysis to ensure that the network topology during augmentation always supports fast convergence.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.\n**DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF IMPACT:**\n- Google Cloud Networking - Affected customers would have observed packet loss for ingress and egress traffic to and from US Central Cloud regions from 13:47 to 14:07 US/Pacific.\n- Cloud VPN - Affected customers would have experienced latency and errors for cross region VPN with global routing from 13:47 to 14:07 US/Pacific. Intra-region traffic for Classic and HA VPN would not have been affected.\n- Cloud Router - Affected customers would have observed delays in global routing propagation from 13:47 to 14:07 US/Pacific.\n- Cloud Interconnect - Affected customers would have experienced latency and errors from 13:47 to 14:07 US/Pacific.\n- Google Cloud Storage - Affected customers would have experienced elevated latency, HTTP 500 errors, or transient API errors from 13:47 to 14:17 US/Pacific.\n- Cloud SQL - Affected customers would have experienced failures for Export, Update, and Delete operations as well as delayed data replication in us-west1 from 13:53 to 14:13 US/Pacific.\n- Messages - Affected customers would have experienced service availability issues from 13:49 to 14:05 US/Pacific.",

      "text": "**INCIDENT REPORT**\n**SUMMARY:**\nOn Friday, 20 May 2022 at 13:47 US/Pacific, Google Cloud Networking experienced intermittent packet loss for traffic between multiple cloud regions for a duration of 20 minutes. The issue was identified and mitigated automatically by 14:07 US/Pacific.\nWe understand this issue has affected our valued customers and users, and we apologize to those who were affected.\n**ROOT CAUSE:**\nGoogle’s production backbone is a global network that enables connectivity for all user-facing traffic via Points of Presence (POPs) or internet exchanges.\nA failure of a component on a fiber path from one of the central US gateway campuses in Google’s production backbone led to a decrease in available network bandwidth between the gateway and multiple edge locations, causing packet loss while the backbone automatically moved traffic onto remaining paths.\nThe network topology in this region is being augmented, and the second-best path has not completed its augmentation. This meant some traffic needed to reroute onto the third-best path, which led to an extended traffic migration period. This disruption was more severe than we had anticipated, and is the subject of remediation actions below.\n**REMEDIATION AND PREVENTION:**\nGoogle’s automated repair mechanisms detected the decrease in available network bandwidth on Friday, 20 May 2022 at 13:47 US/Pacific and automatically routed the traffic through alternate links. The traffic rerouting completed on Friday, 20 May 2022 at 14:06 US/Pacific, mitigating the issue.\nWhile our automated mechanisms worked as intended and recovered the traffic without manual intervention, we understand that the scope of impact caused by this event affected our customers.\nWe have been working on optimizing our global network to minimize the time spent automatically reconfiguring around failures like this (known as \"convergence time\"). While we have made progress, efforts to improve are ongoing. We continue to ensure that the current technology is optimally configured to minimize the frequency and severity of these issues.\nIn this network region, we intend to complete the augmentation by 11 July 2022, which will return the network to the intended topology where any single fiber path failure can be rerouted quickly onto the second-best path.\nWe will also build automatic analysis to ensure that the network topology during augmentation always supports fast convergence.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.\n**DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF IMPACT:**\n- Google Cloud Networking - Affected customers would have observed packet loss for ingress and egress traffic to and from US Central Cloud regions from 13:47 to 14:07 US/Pacific.\n- Cloud VPN - Affected customers would have experienced latency and errors for cross region VPN with global routing from 13:47 to 14:07 US/Pacific. Intra-region traffic for Classic and HA VPN would not have been affected.\n- Cloud Router - Affected customers would have observed delays in global routing propagation from 13:47 to 14:07 US/Pacific.\n- Cloud Interconnect - Affected customers would have experienced latency and errors from 13:47 to 14:07 US/Pacific.\n- Google Cloud Storage - Affected customers would have experienced elevated latency, HTTP 500 errors, or transient API errors from 13:47 to 14:17 US/Pacific.\n- Cloud SQL - Affected customers would have experienced failures for Export, Update, and Delete operations as well as delayed data replication in us-west1 from 13:53 to 14:13 US/Pacific.\n- Messages - Affected customers would have experienced service availability issues from 13:49 to 14:05 US/Pacific.",

        "text": "**INCIDENT REPORT**\n**Summary:**\nOn 6 May 2022 at 01:30 US/Pacific, multiple Google Cloud services experienced issues in the us-central1 region. These issues mostly were isolated to us-central1-b for zonal services, but some regional services experienced degradation until their traffic could be shifted away from the impacted zone. Most Google Cloud services recovered automatically, after the underlying problem was resolved.\nWe sincerely apologize for the impact to your service or application. We completed an internal investigation and are taking immediate steps to improve the quality and reliability of our services. If you believe that your services experienced an SLA violation as a result of this incident, please [contact us](https://support.google.com/cloud/contact/cloud_platform_sla).\n**Root Cause:**\nGoogle Cloud systems are built on a zonal distributed storage system called [Colossus](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/storage-data-transfer/a-peek-behind-colossus-googles-file-system), which replicates data across a large number of individual storage servers called D Servers. In this incident, a background job responsible for repacking storage objects began to retry those repack operations more aggressively as part of its normal operations. This subsequently increased the load on the Colossus system in the zone, including the number of open connections to the D Servers.\nThe sudden increase in connection load to D Servers caused a small number of servers to unexpectedly crash due to high memory pressure. This led our automated management systems to remove them from the serving fleet for Colossus. This further reduced the number of D Servers available to handle the rising traffic loads and increased the traffic latency within the Colossus system in the impacted zone.\nThis significant increase in latency subsequently impacted our customers’ performance across a range of Google Cloud services that are built atop Colossus, including Persistent Disk, BigQuery, and many others.\nThis zonal incident impacted some regional services due to the specific failure mode. When a Colossus cluster is marked down, the regional services receive proactive notification and automatically shift traffic away from the cluster. Since this cluster was still up, but with variable latency for some operations, the regional services received no proactive notification and were unable to automatically shift traffic away from the cluster. Therefore, the impact to a number of regional services was extended as they had to manually remove the impacted cluster from serving.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue on Friday, 6 May, 2022 at 01:54 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation.\nGoogle engineers stopped the background traffic. To increase traffic capacity, Google engineers re-added the impacted D Servers to the serving fleet, mitigating the issue at 12:06 US/Pacific.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We are taking the following steps to prevent this or similar issues from happening again:\n* Investigate and add additional protections in the D Servers to decrease memory pressure during high network traffic load periods.\n* Improve the retry logic for the storage object repacking job to ensure that it cannot overload the Colossus system within a zone.\n* Extend the automated D Server management systems to better handle crash loop conditions and quickly restore D Servers to production once they become healthy.\n* Google's regional services are designed to tolerate zonal failure while staying within their service level objectives. The nature of this failure was not properly handled by some regional services. We are committed to investigating the behavior of each regional service impacted in this outage to ensure that fault tolerance gaps are properly addressed.\n**Detailed Description of Impact:**\nSome customers may have experienced high latency or errors in multiple Google Cloud services in the impacted region.\n* **BigQuery [us-central1 and US multi-region]:** Customers saw increased query, import, and export latencies and errors. The overall duration of impact was 6 hours 5 minutes in us-central1 and 4 hours 34 minutes in US multi-region.\n* **Cloud Bigtable [us-central1-b zone]:** A small number of Customers in us-central1-b experienced elevated latency and errors as well as replication delays for a duration of 10 hours, 36 minutes. A very minor percentage of the affected customers for Cloud Bigtable had residual impact for additional 6 hours, 40 minutes.\n* **Cloud Pub/Sub [us-central1 region]:** Customers may have seen missing backlog stats metrics for subscriptions against topics with messages published to us-central1 for a duration of 2 hours, 41 minutes. Since the impact was based on the message publish region, the subscribers could have been in regions other than us-central1.\n* **Google Cloud Load Balancer (GCLB) [us-central1-b zone]:** New load balancer creations and modifications or deletions of existing components with backends in us-central1-b may have been delayed or not taken effect until the outage was resolved. The total impact duration for GCLB is 4 hours, 46 minutes.\n* **Google Compute Engine (GCE) [us-central1-b zone]:** Customers may have seen issues with instance availability in us-central1-b due to some input/output (I/O) operations in Persistent Disk Standard disks being stuck for over one minute. Additionally, Regional Persistent Disk Standard disks with a replica in us-central1-b may have been briefly affected due to delays in failover. A small number of instances may have experienced brief loss of network connectivity to other Google Cloud services following live migration events. The total impact duration for GCE is around 5 hours, 25 minutes.\n* **Cloud Datastream [us-central1 region]:** Customers may have seen streams enter into \"Failed\" state on the Datastream UI, noticed no new data ingested by Datastream into Google Cloud Storage buckets, had duplicate data loaded into Google Cloud Storage, or metrics not being reported. This impacted a whole region for a duration of 7 hours 40 minutes, because the cluster over provisioning was not at a high enough level, and losing one zone on the underlying Kafka cluster caused the cluster to be at 100% utilization, until it was able to fully copy the data to a new zone.\n* **Cloud Filestore [us-central1-b zone]:** Many Filestore instance creation operations failed. Additionally, a small number of instances were unresponsive for the duration of the incident. Some instances suffered performance impact.\n* **Cloud Memorystore [us-central1-b zone]:** Redis nodes in us-central1-b may have been unavailable for a duration of 3 hours, 54 minutes.\n* **Cloud SQL [us-central1-b zone]:** Customers may not have been able to connect to their instance in us-central1-b through the Cloud SQL Auth proxy for a duration of 3 hours, 5 minutes.\n* **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) [us-central1-b zone]:** Customers may have experienced issues interacting with their clusters' control planes. New workloads may not have been scheduled. Auto scaling may not have been operational.The total impact duration for GKE is 7 hours, 11 minutes.\n* **Apigee [us-central1 region]:** Customers may have seen errors for their API traffic with Datastore Errors. Apigee is internally redundant across zones within the region, but due to the high latency failure mode in us-central1-b, the engineers were not able to remove the impacted zone from the regional cluster. The total impact duration for Apigee is 2 hours, 55 minutes.\n* **Dataflow [us-central1 region]:** New Dataflow jobs may have failed to start in us-central1-b. Jobs already running in us-central1-b may have been stuck or delayed, but restarting the jobs would have automatically routed them to a healthy zone starting at 05:00 US/Pacific if the customer was using auto zone placement. The total impact duration for dataflow is 2 hours, 55 minutes.\n* **Cloud Data Fusion (CDF) [us-central1 region]:** Customers may have experienced DataFusion instance creation failures, instance availability issues and higher data processing pipeline failures. This was because Persistent Disk (PD) issues caused DataFusion backend services to become unhealthy and the total impact duration was about 7 hours.",

These issues were predominantly isolated to us-central1-b for zonal services, but some regional services experienced degradation until their traffic could be shifted away from the impacted zone. Most services recovered automatically after the underlying problem was resolved.\nThe issues were triggered by an unexpected increase in normally occurring background traffic in the Google Cloud distributed storage infrastructure[1] within the us-central1-b zone. The system automatically directed load away from backend file servers that were impacted by this load increase. This subsequently reduced the overall traffic capacity in the zone. Google engineers mitigated the issue by stopping the background traffic and marking the impacted file servers as available in order to increase capacity.\n**Customer Impact:**\n**How Customers Experienced the Issue:** Some customers may have experienced high latency or errors in multiple Google Cloud services in the impacted region.\n* **BigQuery:** Customers may have seen increased query delays and/or failures.\n* **Cloud Bigtable:** Customers may have experienced elevated latency and errors.\n* **Cloud Pub/Sub:** Customers may have seen missing metrics for backlog statistics.\n* **Google Cloud Load Balancer (GCLB):** New load balancer creations, as well as modifications or deletions of existing components, with backends in us-central1-b may have been delayed or not taken effect until the outage was resolved.\n* **Google Compute Engine (GCE):** Customers may have seen issues with instance availability in us-central1-b due to some input/output (I/O) operations in Persistent Disk being stuck for over one minute. A small number of instances may have experienced brief loss of network reachability to other Google Cloud services following live migration events.\n* **Datastream:** Customers may have seen streams enter into \"Failed\" state on the Datastream UI, noticed no new data ingested by Datastream into Google Cloud Storage bucket, or metrics not being reported.\n* **Cloud Filestore:** Customers may have experienced hung tasks in Filestore instances.\n* **Cloud Memorystore:** Redis nodes in us-central1-b may have been unavailable.\n* **Cloud SQL:** Customers may not have been able to connect to their instance in us-central1-b through the proxy-server.\n* **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE):** Customers may have experienced issues interacting with the control plane. New workloads may not have been scheduled. Auto scaling may not have been operational.\n* **Apigee:** Customers may have seen errors for their API traffic with Datastore Errors.\n* **Dataflow:** Some Dataflow batch and streaming jobs in us-central1 may have been stuck or delayed.\n* **Cloud Data Fusion (CDF):** CDF operations, like instance creation and pipeline launch, may have failed in the us-central1 region due to an issue on Compute Engine.\n[1] https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/storage-data-transfer/a-peek-behind-colossus-googles-file-system",

      "text": "**INCIDENT REPORT**\n**Summary:**\nOn 6 May 2022 at 01:30 US/Pacific, multiple Google Cloud services experienced issues in the us-central1 region. These issues mostly were isolated to us-central1-b for zonal services, but some regional services experienced degradation until their traffic could be shifted away from the impacted zone. Most Google Cloud services recovered automatically, after the underlying problem was resolved.\nWe sincerely apologize for the impact to your service or application. We completed an internal investigation and are taking immediate steps to improve the quality and reliability of our services. If you believe that your services experienced an SLA violation as a result of this incident, please [contact us](https://support.google.com/cloud/contact/cloud_platform_sla).\n**Root Cause:**\nGoogle Cloud systems are built on a zonal distributed storage system called [Colossus](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/storage-data-transfer/a-peek-behind-colossus-googles-file-system), which replicates data across a large number of individual storage servers called D Servers. In this incident, a background job responsible for repacking storage objects began to retry those repack operations more aggressively as part of its normal operations. This subsequently increased the load on the Colossus system in the zone, including the number of open connections to the D Servers.\nThe sudden increase in connection load to D Servers caused a small number of servers to unexpectedly crash due to high memory pressure. This led our automated management systems to remove them from the serving fleet for Colossus. This further reduced the number of D Servers available to handle the rising traffic loads and increased the traffic latency within the Colossus system in the impacted zone.\nThis significant increase in latency subsequently impacted our customers’ performance across a range of Google Cloud services that are built atop Colossus, including Persistent Disk, BigQuery, and many others.\nThis zonal incident impacted some regional services due to the specific failure mode. When a Colossus cluster is marked down, the regional services receive proactive notification and automatically shift traffic away from the cluster. Since this cluster was still up, but with variable latency for some operations, the regional services received no proactive notification and were unable to automatically shift traffic away from the cluster. Therefore, the impact to a number of regional services was extended as they had to manually remove the impacted cluster from serving.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue on Friday, 6 May, 2022 at 01:54 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation.\nGoogle engineers stopped the background traffic. To increase traffic capacity, Google engineers re-added the impacted D Servers to the serving fleet, mitigating the issue at 12:06 US/Pacific.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We are taking the following steps to prevent this or similar issues from happening again:\n* Investigate and add additional protections in the D Servers to decrease memory pressure during high network traffic load periods.\n* Improve the retry logic for the storage object repacking job to ensure that it cannot overload the Colossus system within a zone.\n* Extend the automated D Server management systems to better handle crash loop conditions and quickly restore D Servers to production once they become healthy.\n* Google's regional services are designed to tolerate zonal failure while staying within their service level objectives. The nature of this failure was not properly handled by some regional services. We are committed to investigating the behavior of each regional service impacted in this outage to ensure that fault tolerance gaps are properly addressed.\n**Detailed Description of Impact:**\nSome customers may have experienced high latency or errors in multiple Google Cloud services in the impacted region.\n* **BigQuery [us-central1 and US multi-region]:** Customers saw increased query, import, and export latencies and errors. The overall duration of impact was 6 hours 5 minutes in us-central1 and 4 hours 34 minutes in US multi-region.\n* **Cloud Bigtable [us-central1-b zone]:** A small number of Customers in us-central1-b experienced elevated latency and errors as well as replication delays for a duration of 10 hours, 36 minutes. A very minor percentage of the affected customers for Cloud Bigtable had residual impact for additional 6 hours, 40 minutes.\n* **Cloud Pub/Sub [us-central1 region]:** Customers may have seen missing backlog stats metrics for subscriptions against topics with messages published to us-central1 for a duration of 2 hours, 41 minutes. Since the impact was based on the message publish region, the subscribers could have been in regions other than us-central1.\n* **Google Cloud Load Balancer (GCLB) [us-central1-b zone]:** New load balancer creations and modifications or deletions of existing components with backends in us-central1-b may have been delayed or not taken effect until the outage was resolved. The total impact duration for GCLB is 4 hours, 46 minutes.\n* **Google Compute Engine (GCE) [us-central1-b zone]:** Customers may have seen issues with instance availability in us-central1-b due to some input/output (I/O) operations in Persistent Disk Standard disks being stuck for over one minute. Additionally, Regional Persistent Disk Standard disks with a replica in us-central1-b may have been briefly affected due to delays in failover. A small number of instances may have experienced brief loss of network connectivity to other Google Cloud services following live migration events. The total impact duration for GCE is around 5 hours, 25 minutes.\n* **Cloud Datastream [us-central1 region]:** Customers may have seen streams enter into \"Failed\" state on the Datastream UI, noticed no new data ingested by Datastream into Google Cloud Storage buckets, had duplicate data loaded into Google Cloud Storage, or metrics not being reported. This impacted a whole region for a duration of 7 hours 40 minutes, because the cluster over provisioning was not at a high enough level, and losing one zone on the underlying Kafka cluster caused the cluster to be at 100% utilization, until it was able to fully copy the data to a new zone.\n* **Cloud Filestore [us-central1-b zone]:** Many Filestore instance creation operations failed. Additionally, a small number of instances were unresponsive for the duration of the incident. Some instances suffered performance impact.\n* **Cloud Memorystore [us-central1-b zone]:** Redis nodes in us-central1-b may have been unavailable for a duration of 3 hours, 54 minutes.\n* **Cloud SQL [us-central1-b zone]:** Customers may not have been able to connect to their instance in us-central1-b through the Cloud SQL Auth proxy for a duration of 3 hours, 5 minutes.\n* **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) [us-central1-b zone]:** Customers may have experienced issues interacting with their clusters' control planes. New workloads may not have been scheduled. Auto scaling may not have been operational.The total impact duration for GKE is 7 hours, 11 minutes.\n* **Apigee [us-central1 region]:** Customers may have seen errors for their API traffic with Datastore Errors. Apigee is internally redundant across zones within the region, but due to the high latency failure mode in us-central1-b, the engineers were not able to remove the impacted zone from the regional cluster. The total impact duration for Apigee is 2 hours, 55 minutes.\n* **Dataflow [us-central1 region]:** New Dataflow jobs may have failed to start in us-central1-b. Jobs already running in us-central1-b may have been stuck or delayed, but restarting the jobs would have automatically routed them to a healthy zone starting at 05:00 US/Pacific if the customer was using auto zone placement. The total impact duration for dataflow is 2 hours, 55 minutes.\n* **Cloud Data Fusion (CDF) [us-central1 region]:** Customers may have experienced DataFusion instance creation failures, instance availability issues and higher data processing pipeline failures. This was because Persistent Disk (PD) issues caused DataFusion backend services to become unhealthy and the total impact duration was about 7 hours.",

Additionally, customers were unable to create, view, or search support cases in the Google Cloud Support Center and Google Admin Console for 1 hour and 24 minutes. We sincerely apologize for the impact to your service or application. We have completed an internal investigation and are taking immediate steps to improve our service’s quality and reliability.\n**Root Cause:**\nThe Serverless stack relies on a file serving service for container images. The issue was triggered when the file serving component of the Serverless stack experienced a sudden increase in traffic. A bug, introduced in a recent configuration change to the file serving service, was surfaced by the sudden increase in traffic, causing many threads to get stuck. This led to resource exhaustion on the affected file servers, causing some tasks to crash and preventing new requests from completing.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue on Thursday, 28 April 2022, at 07:11 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Once the affected component was identified, engineers added additional capacity to the component in the zone that was experiencing the degradation. This mitigated the resource exhaustion, and the service recovered at 08:20 US/Pacific.\nTo prevent recurrence of the issue, engineers rolled back the configuration change to the previous stable version and implemented an automated release block to prevent any unintended release of a version that included the bug.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We are taking the following steps to prevent this or similar issues from happening again:\nTo improve resolution time for future issues of this type, we are calibrating our alerting system to give us an earlier and more precise notification which will allow us to diagnose the issue more quickly.\nWe are also evaluating what kinds of load/stress tests could deterministically detect this kind of issue in the future, so that such regressions are caught automatically before they are deployed to production.\n**Detailed Description of Impact:**\nOn 28th April 2022 from 7:00 PT to 8:32 PT\n**Google App Engine**\nGoogle App Engine experienced increased latency and reduced availability in one zone in us-central1 for a period of 1 hour and 32 minutes. Customers may have experienced increased latency or higher error rate for App Engine projects.\n**Google Cloud Functions**\nGoogle Cloud Functions experienced increased latency and reduced availability in one zone in us-central1 for a period of 1 hour and 32 minutes. “Google Cloud Functions” customers updating their functions (e.g. deploying a new version) may have experienced increased latency or failures, notably failing health checks.\n**Google Cloud Support and Google Workspace Support**\nCustomers were unable to create, view, or search support cases in the Google Cloud Support Center or Google Admin Console for 1 hour and 24 minutes. In addition, a small number of customers had degraded access to phone support, being redirected to a queue requiring additional manual authentication with the support agent.",

Customers using global storage buckets or storage buckets in us-central1 to store their logs may not have been able to see their recently written logs for a duration of 20 hours, 41 minutes.\nFrom preliminary analysis, an unexpected increase in uncached NOT_FOUND errors while validating log bucket configurations caused a large increase in the overall volume of configuration reads. This in turn caused latency of configuration reads and therefore validations to increase, leading to an ingestion backlog and a delay in log ingestion to the storage layer of our query backend.\nThe issue was resolved at 17:33 US/Pacific once the ingestion backlog cleared.\n**Customer Impact:**\n- Customers using global storage buckets or storage buckets in us-central1 to store their logs may not have been able to see their recently written logs for most of the duration of the event.\n- Customers may have experienced high latency or failures up to 90% on reads from Google Cloud Logging and other query requests.",

Customers using global storage buckets or storage buckets in us-central1 to store their logs may not have been able to see their recently written logs for a duration of 20 hours, 41 minutes.\nFrom preliminary analysis, an unexpected increase in uncached NOT_FOUND errors while validating log bucket configurations caused a large increase in the overall volume of configuration reads. This in turn caused latency of configuration reads and therefore validations to increase, leading to an ingestion backlog and a delay in log ingestion to the storage layer of our query backend.\nThe issue was resolved at 17:33 US/Pacific once the ingestion backlog cleared.\n**Customer Impact:**\n- Customers using global storage buckets or storage buckets in us-central1 to store their logs may not have been able to see their recently written logs for most of the duration of the event.\n- Customers may have experienced high latency or failures up to 90% on reads from Google Cloud Logging and other query requests.",

From the preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue is a rollout on the configuration management system that manages and pushes configuration for multiple Google infrastructure systems. The roll out caused an increase in the task counts which overloaded the configuration management system as all tasks pulled the configuration at the same time.\n**Customer Impact:**\n* Affected customers would have experienced delays in creating or modifying the configuration of Global External HTTP(S) load balancers, Cloud Armor and Cloud CDN.\n* App Engine Flexible apps might have failed to deploy.",

Google apologizes to customers who were affected by this outage and is taking steps to ensure that this type of outage does not reoccur.\n**Root Cause**\nOur investigation found the cause was a backend configuration change to our Cloud Monitoring service. This configuration changed the computation of some metrics not directly related to, but shared by, Cloud Pub/Sub. This configuration change progressively rolled out across all Google Cloud regions over two hours.\nThis configuration change increased the latency of requests to record metrics sent from Cloud Pub/Sub to Cloud Monitoring and, in some cases, resulted in failures due to write operations timing out.\n**Remediation and Prevention**\nEngineers were able to mitigate the issue by reverting the change that caused the issue, restoring services for all customers at 15:54 US/Pacific.\nWe are taking the following actions to ensure this does not happen again:\n- Improving the monitoring of Cloud Pub/Sub metrics reporting to allow for quicker error detection.\n- Making Cloud Pub/Sub metrics reporting operations more resilient to high latency.\n- Improving internal visibility and vetting of Cloud Monitoring backend configuration changes.\n**Detailed Description of Impact**\nOn Thursday March 31st, between 08:30 and 15:54 US/Pacific time:\n**Cloud Pub/Sub Metrics in Cloud Reporting**\n- The metric values lost during this timeframe are not recoverable.\n- Any alerting based on these metrics might have fired erroneously or not fired when it should have.\n- Auto scaling of Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) based on these metrics may not have functioned as expected.",

Google apologizes to customers who were affected by this outage and is taking steps to ensure that this type of outage does not reoccur.\n**Root Cause**\nOur investigation found the cause was a backend configuration change to our Cloud Monitoring service. This configuration changed the computation of some metrics not directly related to, but shared by, Cloud Pub/Sub. This configuration change progressively rolled out across all Google Cloud regions over two hours.\nThis configuration change increased the latency of requests to record metrics sent from Cloud Pub/Sub to Cloud Monitoring and, in some cases, resulted in failures due to write operations timing out.\n**Remediation and Prevention**\nEngineers were able to mitigate the issue by reverting the change that caused the issue, restoring services for all customers at 15:54 US/Pacific.\nWe are taking the following actions to ensure this does not happen again:\n- Improving the monitoring of Cloud Pub/Sub metrics reporting to allow for quicker error detection.\n- Making Cloud Pub/Sub metrics reporting operations more resilient to high latency.\n- Improving internal visibility and vetting of Cloud Monitoring backend configuration changes.\n**Detailed Description of Impact**\nOn Thursday March 31st, between 08:30 and 15:54 US/Pacific time:\n**Cloud Pub/Sub Metrics in Cloud Reporting**\n- The metric values lost during this timeframe are not recoverable.\n- Any alerting based on these metrics might have fired erroneously or not fired when it should have.\n- Auto scaling of Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) based on these metrics may not have functioned as expected.",

        "text": "**Summary**\nOn Tuesday, 22 March 2022, Google Cloud Networking experienced congestion on network infrastructure to and from the network edge locations [1] in Queretaro, Mexico, for a duration of 1 hour and 45 minutes, following multiple fiber cuts between the United States and Mexico. Affected customers may have experienced high latency, high retransmits and elevated errors.\nWe would like to apologize for the length and severity of this incident. We are taking immediate steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future.\n[1] - https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/edge-locations\n**Root Cause**\nGoogle’s wide-area network is primarily comprised of infrastructure owned and operated by Google, although some physical links use fiber infrastructure which is owned and operated by third parties. Google has multiple resilient fiber paths and network points of presence serving users in Mexico.\nMultiple simultaneous fiber cuts on diversely-routed paths, at the same time as a planned maintenance event on another diversely-routed path, resulted in a capacity shortfall in Google’s wide-area network between Queretaro, Mexico and the United States. This multiple failure event represents a rare case in which the resulting capacity shortfall was visible to Google's users.\nTraffic was subsequently redirected to alternate links; however, there was insufficient capacity to serve all the redirected traffic, resulting in packet loss for user-facing network traffic to Google from users in Mexico.\n**Remediation and Prevention**\nGoogle’s automated repair mechanism detected the congestion on Tuesday, 22 March 2022, at 15:42 US/Pacific and redirected the traffic through alternate edge locations. However, the alternate link did not have sufficient capacity to serve all the redirected traffic, resulting in packet loss. The congestion was cleared when traffic was manually routed around the failed links on Tuesday, 22 March 2022, at 17:15 US/Pacific.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. However, this incident was the result of multiple concurrent failures on links which are designed to provide resilience; such failures, whilst very rare, are expected at a low frequency. We are taking the following steps to ensure we respond quickly to similar events in the future:\n* Improving the reliability of tooling that manually reroutes traffic in extreme multiple-failure scenarios.\n* Improving the diagnostic systems that help Google's Cloud Networking teams decide how to deal with extreme multiple-failure scenarios.\nWe appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.\n**Detailed Description of Impact**\nOn Tuesday, 22 March 2022 from 15:30 to 17:15 US/Pacific, customers reaching Google services from Mexico may have experienced network slowness and packet loss, and errors returned from our services. This may have resulted in customers not being able to access services running on Google Cloud and Workspace services including:\n* Google Meet\n* Gmail\n* Google Drive",

      "text": "**Summary**\nOn Tuesday, 22 March 2022, Google Cloud Networking experienced congestion on network infrastructure to and from the network edge locations [1] in Queretaro, Mexico, for a duration of 1 hour and 45 minutes, following multiple fiber cuts between the United States and Mexico. Affected customers may have experienced high latency, high retransmits and elevated errors.\nWe would like to apologize for the length and severity of this incident. We are taking immediate steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future.\n[1] - https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/edge-locations\n**Root Cause**\nGoogle’s wide-area network is primarily comprised of infrastructure owned and operated by Google, although some physical links use fiber infrastructure which is owned and operated by third parties. Google has multiple resilient fiber paths and network points of presence serving users in Mexico.\nMultiple simultaneous fiber cuts on diversely-routed paths, at the same time as a planned maintenance event on another diversely-routed path, resulted in a capacity shortfall in Google’s wide-area network between Queretaro, Mexico and the United States. This multiple failure event represents a rare case in which the resulting capacity shortfall was visible to Google's users.\nTraffic was subsequently redirected to alternate links; however, there was insufficient capacity to serve all the redirected traffic, resulting in packet loss for user-facing network traffic to Google from users in Mexico.\n**Remediation and Prevention**\nGoogle’s automated repair mechanism detected the congestion on Tuesday, 22 March 2022, at 15:42 US/Pacific and redirected the traffic through alternate edge locations. However, the alternate link did not have sufficient capacity to serve all the redirected traffic, resulting in packet loss. The congestion was cleared when traffic was manually routed around the failed links on Tuesday, 22 March 2022, at 17:15 US/Pacific.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. However, this incident was the result of multiple concurrent failures on links which are designed to provide resilience; such failures, whilst very rare, are expected at a low frequency. We are taking the following steps to ensure we respond quickly to similar events in the future:\n* Improving the reliability of tooling that manually reroutes traffic in extreme multiple-failure scenarios.\n* Improving the diagnostic systems that help Google's Cloud Networking teams decide how to deal with extreme multiple-failure scenarios.\nWe appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.\n**Detailed Description of Impact**\nOn Tuesday, 22 March 2022 from 15:30 to 17:15 US/Pacific, customers reaching Google services from Mexico may have experienced network slowness and packet loss, and errors returned from our services. This may have resulted in customers not being able to access services running on Google Cloud and Workspace services including:\n* Google Meet\n* Gmail\n* Google Drive",

The issue was identified and mitigated automatically by 15:28 US/Pacific.\nWe understand this issue has affected our valued customers and users, and we apologize to those who were affected.\n**Root Cause**\nGoogle’s production backbone is a global network that enables connectivity for all user-facing traffic via Points of Presence (POPs) or internet exchanges.\nA rare hardware failure of a component on the fiber paths from one of the transpacific gateway campuses in Google’s production backbone led to a decrease in available network bandwidth between the gateway and multiple edge locations, causing packet loss.\n**Remediation and Prevention**\nGoogle’s automated repair mechanisms detected the decrease in available network bandwidth on Friday, 18 March 2022 at 15:20 US/Pacific and automatically routed the traffic through alternate links. The traffic rerouting completed on Friday, 18 March 2022 at 15:28 US/Pacific, mitigating the issue.\nWhile our automated mechanisms worked as intended and recovered the traffic without manual intervention, we understand that the scope of impact caused by this rare event affected our customers. We have been working on optimizing our global network to minimize the time spent automatically reconfiguring around failures like this (known as \"convergence time\"). While we have made progress, efforts to improve still further remain ongoing. We continue to ensure that the current technology is optimally configured to minimize the frequency and severity of these issues.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions.

The issue was identified and mitigated automatically by 15:28 US/Pacific.\nWe understand this issue has affected our valued customers and users, and we apologize to those who were affected.\n**Root Cause**\nGoogle’s production backbone is a global network that enables connectivity for all user-facing traffic via Points of Presence (POPs) or internet exchanges.\nA rare hardware failure of a component on the fiber paths from one of the transpacific gateway campuses in Google’s production backbone led to a decrease in available network bandwidth between the gateway and multiple edge locations, causing packet loss.\n**Remediation and Prevention**\nGoogle’s automated repair mechanisms detected the decrease in available network bandwidth on Friday, 18 March 2022 at 15:20 US/Pacific and automatically routed the traffic through alternate links. The traffic rerouting completed on Friday, 18 March 2022 at 15:28 US/Pacific, mitigating the issue.\nWhile our automated mechanisms worked as intended and recovered the traffic without manual intervention, we understand that the scope of impact caused by this rare event affected our customers. We have been working on optimizing our global network to minimize the time spent automatically reconfiguring around failures like this (known as \"convergence time\"). While we have made progress, efforts to improve still further remain ongoing. We continue to ensure that the current technology is optimally configured to minimize the frequency and severity of these issues.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.\n**Detailed Description of Impact**\nCustomers may have observed packet loss for traffic routed via transpacific links on Google's backbone. This could include traffic from or to any of the following cloud regions:\n* asia-east1\n* asia-northeast1\n* asia-northeast2\n* asia-northeast3\n* asia-southeast1\n* asia-southeast2\n* australia-southeast1\n* australia-southeast2\n* us-west1\n* us-central1\n* us-east1\n* us-east4\n* northamerica-northeast1\n* europe-west1\n* europe-west2\n* europe-west3\n* europe-west4\n* europe-west6\n* europe-west8\n* europe-west9\n* europe-central2\n* europe-north1",

To our Traffic Director customers who were impacted during this service disruption, we sincerely apologize. We have conducted an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve our service.\n**Root Cause**\nTraffic Director has a configuration pipeline that distributes customer configurations to Traffic Director infrastructure globally. The configuration pipeline has been undergoing a multi-stage, multi-year architectural rewrite to address a number of limitations in the previous architecture. One step to move to the new architecture has been to migrate existing Traffic Director configurations to a different format. This data migration has been ongoing since November 2021. The Traffic Director code was updated to handle both old and new formats of the configuration.\nThe data format migration was not fully completed; it encountered sporadic failures that were believed to only affect test configurations of new unreleased features. These failures masked the true completion state for full migration of all customer data. As a result, some customer data was an inconsistent state of old and new formats.\nOn 8 March 2022 at 10:05 PT, a change to the Traffic Director code that processes the configuration was updated. The code change assumed that the configuration data format migration was fully completed. In fact, the data migration had not completed. The failures were believed to only affect test configurations of new unreleased features, but they also affected a certain set of customer configurations that met all of the following criteria:\n1. The project was part of a Shared VPC.\n2. The project had at least one configuration migrated to the new format, which would be true if: a. The customer modified the project configuration after 12 November 2021; or b. The internal migration tool successfully processed the configuration.\n3. The project had at least one configuration that was not migrated to the new format: a. The customer had not modified the project since 12 November 2021; or b.The internal migration tool failed to process the configuration.\n4. The hostname of interest was part of the migrated configuration or the data plane requested configuration from the Traffic Director based on the migrated configuration.\nIt would inadvertently delete the configurations which caused the downstream clients to lose their programming and deconfigure the data plane.\nThe change was rolled back, the configurations were recovered, and service was restored for all users.\n**Remediation and Prevention**\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue through a customer support case on 8 March 2022 at 10:24 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation.\nOnce the nature and scope of the issue became clear, Google engineers rolled back the Traffic Director configuration rollout to prevent additional customer impact.\nAt 12:42 US/Pacific, engineers forced a reprogramming of configurations, which mitigated the issue.\nWe sincerely apologize for the length and severity of this incident. Our team at Google is taking immediate steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future.\n**Detailed Description of Impact**\nOn Tuesday, 8 March 2022 from 10:07 to 12:42 US/Pacific, customers using Traffic Director-managed backends experienced elevated service errors. Affected customers would have seen their Traffic Director managed clients deprogrammed as the configuration was removed. The effect of the deprogramming for users behind Google Cloud Load Balancers (GCLB) would have been visible as 500 errors. Some affected customers were able to mitigate the issue for themselves through the workaround of moving to backends that were not Traffic Director managed.",

The hostname of interest was part of the migrated configuration or the data plane requested configuration from the Traffic Director based on the migrated configuration.\nIt would inadvertently delete the configurations which caused the downstream clients to lose their programming and deconfigure the data plane.\nThe change was rolled back, the configurations were recovered, and service was restored for all users.\n**Remediation and Prevention**\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue through a customer support case on 8 March 2022 at 10:24 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation.\nOnce the nature and scope of the issue became clear, Google engineers rolled back the Traffic Director configuration rollout to prevent additional customer impact.\nAt 12:42 US/Pacific, engineers forced a reprogramming of configurations, which mitigated the issue.\nWe sincerely apologize for the length and severity of this incident. Our team at Google is taking immediate steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future.\n**Detailed Description of Impact**\nOn Tuesday, 8 March 2022 from 10:07 to 12:42 US/Pacific, customers using Traffic Director-managed backends experienced elevated service errors. Affected customers would have seen their Traffic Director managed clients deprogrammed as the configuration was removed. The effect of the deprogramming for users behind Google Cloud Load Balancers (GCLB) would have been visible as 500 errors. Some affected customers were able to mitigate the issue for themselves through the workaround of moving to backends that were not Traffic Director managed.",

To our affected customers in us-west1-b who were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nGoogle leverages \"Software-defined Networking” (SDN) to simplify and automate the growth and expansion of our data center networks. This allows us to dynamically scale up data center networks to meet customer demand. This outage began when a routine maintenance event was performed on one of the SDN components. This maintenance event triggered an application failover that prompted a newly active replica to perform reconciliation from a previous checkpoint. These events are expected to be seamless and cause no network disruption. However, the checkpoint data was incorrectly missing a particular piece of configuration information; this was propagated to ~15% of the network switches serving us-west1-b.\nSeconds after this event, the SDN automatically corrected the incomplete configuration. Reprogramming of the affected switches triggered a race condition within the switch firmware, eventually causing them to crash. Automatic repair and mitigation actions were invoked within 10 minutes of switches failing. However, the unexpectedly large number, and network proximity, of the failures prevented a fully automatic recovery. As such, the outage was not mitigated until on-call engineers manually recovered the affected switches. The corrupted checkpoint data was only present in a single location and therefore no other cloud zone was ever at risk.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nThe outage was detected by Google Engineers on Saturday, 8 January at 15:25 US/Pacific, who immediately started an investigation. At 16:03, engineers tried to migrate traffic away from the impacted switches in the switch fabric, but this did not resolve the issue. At 17:19, engineers ascertained that the impacted switches needed to have their services restarted, and at 17:37, they began to do so. The network issue was mitigated at 18:00, when enough switches had been restarted to successfully serve all network traffic. The issue was fully resolved by 18:36, when all services were marked as recovered.\nThe conditions that caused this disruption existed only in a small subset of Google's network. The function responsible for causing it has been disabled and will not be reenabled until the steps below have been fully implemented.\n1. Avoiding the trigger: - We have audited and disabled the SDN feature that triggered this incident. - We have identified test coverage gaps in our SDN release process, which will be addressed to prevent a repeat of this and other similar issues. - Our systems will be modified to validate SDN checkpoint data before it is persisted for later recovery. - Our SDN maintenance workflow safety checks will be enhanced to automatically stop the workflow during an outage.\n2. Ensure changes are applied to the SDN more progressively: - We will redistribute SDN services to limit the areas impacted by failed maintenance workflows. - We will be developing new SDN safety components that validate potentially disruptive operations by applying them to network devices that are similarly configured, but not currently active, before deploying them further.\n3. Reduce time to resolution: - We will improve network management tooling to simplify and expedite mass switch recovery. - We will deploy monitoring improvements to more quickly identify broad network switch failures.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Saturday, 8 January from 15:15 to 18:36 US/Pacific:\n#### Cloud Router\nAffected Cloud Router customers would have experienced elevated packet loss from 40% to 100%.\n#### Cloud VPN\nAffected Cloud VPN customers would have experienced elevated packet loss from 40% to 100%.\n#### Cloud DNS\nCloud DNS customers experienced increased latency and errors on DNS requests.\n#### Cloud AI\nCloud AI customers experienced elevated latency on prediction requests.\n#### Cloud Run\nCloud Run customers experienced network connectivity issues.\n#### Cloud Spanner\nCloud Spanner Customers experienced elevated latency.\n#### Google Compute Engine\nGoogle Compute Engine customers experienced network latency, connectivity issues and slow input/output (I/O) operations on disks due to network latency, which may have manifested as unresponsive Compute Engine instances, including Google Kubernetes instances.\n#### Other Services\nOther services that require Google Cloud Networking in us-west1-b were also affected.

Thank you for your patience and understanding as we worked to resolve the issue.\nWe want to share some information about what happened and the steps we are taking to ensure this issue doesn’t occur again. We also want to assure you that this service disruption does not have any bearing on our preparedness or platform reliability going into Black Friday/Cyber Monday (BFCM).\n## Incident Summary\nOn Tuesday, 16 November 2021 at 09:35 PT, Google Cloud Networking experienced issues with the Google External Proxy Load Balancing (GCLB) service. Affected customers received Google 404 errors in response to HTTP/S requests.\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue via automated alerting at 09:50 PT, which aligned with incoming customer support requests, and we immediately started to mitigate the issue by rolling back to the last known good configuration.\nBetween 09:35 and 10:08 PT, customers affected by the outage may have encountered 404 errors when accessing any web page (URL) served by Google External Proxy Load Balancing.\nA rollback to the last known good configuration completed at 10:08 PT, which resolved the 404 errors. To avoid the risk of a recurrence, our engineers suspended customer-initiated configuration changes in GCLB. As a result, GCLB service customers were unable to make changes to their load balancing configuration between 10:04 and 11:28 PT.\nDuring the change suspension period, we validated the fix to safeguard against recurrence and deployed additional proctoring and monitoring to ensure safe resumption of service.\nBy 11:28 PT, customer configuration pushes resumed, and normal service was restored. The total duration of impact was 1 hour and 53 minutes.\n## Root Cause\nThis incident was caused by a bug in the configuration pipeline that propagates customer configuration rules to GCLB. The bug was introduced 6 months ago and allowed a race condition (when behavior depends on the timing of data accesses) that would, in very rare cases, push a corrupted configuration file to GCLB. The GCLB update pipeline contains extensive validation checks to prevent corrupt configurations, but the race condition was one that could corrupt the file near the end of the pipeline.\nA Google engineer discovered this bug on 12 November, which caused us to declare an internal high-priority incident because of the latent risk to production systems. After analyzing the bug, we froze a part of our configuration system to make the likelihood of the race condition even lower. Since the race condition had existed in the fleet for several months already, the team believed that this extra step made the risk even lower. Thus the team believed the lowest-risk path, especially given the proximity to BFCM, was to roll out fixes in a controlled manner as opposed to a same-day emergency patch.\nWe developed two mitigations: patch A closed the race condition itself; and patch B added additional input validation to the binary receiving the configuration to prevent it from accepting the new configuration, even if the race condition occurred.\nBoth patches were ready and verified to fix the problem by 13 November. Gradual rollouts of both patches started on Monday, 15 November, and patch B completed rollout by that evening. On Tuesday, 16 November, as the patch A rollout was within 30 minutes of completing, the race condition did manifest in an unpatched cluster, and the outage started.\nAdditionally, even though patch B did protect against the kind of input errors observed during testing, the actual race condition produced a different form of error in the configuration, which the completed rollout of patch B did not prevent from being accepted.\nOnce the root cause was identified, our engineers mitigated the issue by restoring a known-good configuration, and completed and verified the fix, which eliminates the risk of recurrence.\n## Service(s) Affected:\n- Google Cloud Networking: Customer HTTP/S endpoints served 404 error pages. During partial recovery, traffic was served, but customers were unable to make changes to their load balancer configurations.\n- GCLB can be used to load balance traffic to a number of other Google Cloud services, which lost traffic because of the outage. Customers who use serverless network endpoint groups on GCLB as a frontend to Google Cloud Run, Google App Engine, Google App Engine Flex, or Google Cloud Functions received 404 errors when attempting to access their service. Customers using Apigee, Firebase, or Google App Engine Flex received 404 errors when attempting to access their service.\n## Zone(s) Affected:\nGlobal\n## How Customers Experienced the Issue:\nBetween 09:35 and 10:08 PT, most endpoints served by global GCLB load balancers returned a 404 error. For an additional 1 hour and 20 minutes, customers were unable to make changes to their load balancing configuration.\n## Workaround(s):\nNone.\nService was restored on 16 November 2021 at 11:28 PT, and the Google Cloud Status Dashboard was updated by 12:08 PT to reflect this.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nWe have fixed the underlying bug and are taking the following actions to prevent recurrence:\nWe immediately added additional alerting, which will notify us to similar issues significantly faster going forward.\nWe are adding safeguards to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. These safeguards provide strengthened automated correctness-checking to configurations before they are applied.\nWe are accelerating planned architectural changes that will improve how we isolate and resolve such issues in the future.",

Customers who use serverless network endpoint groups on GCLB as a frontend to Google Cloud Run, Google App Engine, Google App Engine Flex, or Google Cloud Functions received 404 errors when attempting to access their service. Customers using Apigee, Firebase, or Google App Engine Flex received 404 errors when attempting to access their service.\n## Zone(s) Affected:\nGlobal\n## How Customers Experienced the Issue:\nBetween 09:35 and 10:08 PT, most endpoints served by global GCLB load balancers returned a 404 error. For an additional 1 hour and 20 minutes, customers were unable to make changes to their load balancing configuration.\n## Workaround(s):\nNone.\nService was restored on 16 November 2021 at 11:28 PT, and the Google Cloud Status Dashboard was updated by 12:08 PT to reflect this.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nWe have fixed the underlying bug and are taking the following actions to prevent recurrence:\nWe immediately added additional alerting, which will notify us to similar issues significantly faster going forward.\nWe are adding safeguards to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. These safeguards provide strengthened automated correctness-checking to configurations before they are applied.\nWe are accelerating planned architectural changes that will improve how we isolate and resolve such issues in the future.",

The root cause of the issue is a MySQL bug https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=105761 that may affect customers who migrated to MySQL version 5.7.36 on or after November 2nd 2021, from a source database that had gtid_mode set to ON.\n**Customer Impact:**\nCloud SQL External Server or Database Migration Service (DMS) users who migrated to Cloud SQL for MySQL 5.7.36, with replication using managed dumps may have experienced replication failures if they have insert/update/delete transactions during the dump phase. Furthermore, if updates were made to those jobs during the replication phase, the migration job may have failed.\nThe issue was observed when ALL the following conditions are met:\n* Cloud SQL MySQL version migrated to is 5.7.36.\n* Source database gtid_mode is ON.\n* Customer is running continuous migration (see DMS doc https://cloud.google.com/database-migration/docs/mysql/create-migration-job).\n* Customer is not migrating with a file, i.e. migration is using a managed dump.\nNew instances should not experience this issue, but please follow the below recommended workaround for existing instances that are impacted.

We apologize for the inconvenience and are taking steps toward preventing recurrence in the future.\n## Root Cause\nCloud Monitoring is a global service but is subdivided into internal locales, each of which collect monitoring data which is generated locally. When users query Cloud Monitoring, each query fans out through a series of nodes (called mixers) within the corresponding locales. The mixers reach out to source nodes to gather the appropriate data, temporarily retaining it within a limited set of memory.\nDuring a recent infrastructure change in the U.S. locale, the amount of memory allocated to mixers in the us-central1 region was inadvertently reduced. This caused mixer tasks to run low on memory. The number of tasks in a low memory state grew over a period of several days as the change was gradually rolled out to production, following Google's standard progressive rollout policies.\nThe mixer task has safeguards which are designed to detect and reduce the impact of low memory conditions by pausing queries that use significant memory. However, in this case, an existing misconfiguration of this safeguard prevented it from activating correctly. Eventually, tasks which were low on memory failed; enough tasks failed in total to cause widespread failures and service impact.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the problem on 19 October 2021 at 11:11 and immediately started an investigation. Root cause - the reduction in memory allocation for mixer nodes - was identified at 11:32. Google engineers quickly identified a mitigation, which we began to roll out at 11:50. Restoring the proper memory capacity for mixer nodes fully mitigated the issue at 12:54.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions.\nWe are taking the following immediate steps to prevent this or similar issues from happening again:\n- Fixing the misconfiguration so that mixers which are low on memory will correctly detect that condition.\n- Introduce load-shedding, such that mixers which run out of memory will simply reject new queries until memory usage subsides, rather than failing.\n- Optimize the mixers to reduce the likelihood of out-of-memory scenarios.\n- Modifying Cloud Monitoring's rollout automation so that it automatically spots problems of this type, allowing engineers to be alerted sooner.",

      "text": "# INCIDENT REPORT\n## Summary\nOn 19 October 2021 11:00 US/Pacific, Cloud Monitoring experienced errors querying all monitoring data for approximately 1 hour and 45 minutes in the us-central1 region. We apologize for the inconvenience and are taking steps toward preventing recurrence in the future.\n## Root Cause\nCloud Monitoring is a global service but is subdivided into internal locales, each of which collect monitoring data which is generated locally. When users query Cloud Monitoring, each query fans out through a series of nodes (called mixers) within the corresponding locales. The mixers reach out to source nodes to gather the appropriate data, temporarily retaining it within a limited set of memory.\nDuring a recent infrastructure change in the U.S. locale, the amount of memory allocated to mixers in the us-central1 region was inadvertently reduced. This caused mixer tasks to run low on memory. The number of tasks in a low memory state grew over a period of several days as the change was gradually rolled out to production, following Google's standard progressive rollout policies.\nThe mixer task has safeguards which are designed to detect and reduce the impact of low memory conditions by pausing queries that use significant memory. However, in this case, an existing misconfiguration of this safeguard prevented it from activating correctly. Eventually, tasks which were low on memory failed; enough tasks failed in total to cause widespread failures and service impact.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the problem on 19 October 2021 at 11:11 and immediately started an investigation. Root cause - the reduction in memory allocation for mixer nodes - was identified at 11:32. Google engineers quickly identified a mitigation, which we began to roll out at 11:50. Restoring the proper memory capacity for mixer nodes fully mitigated the issue at 12:54.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions.\nWe are taking the following immediate steps to prevent this or similar issues from happening again:\n- Fixing the misconfiguration so that mixers which are low on memory will correctly detect that condition.\n- Introduce load-shedding, such that mixers which run out of memory will simply reject new queries until memory usage subsides, rather than failing.\n- Optimize the mixers to reduce the likelihood of out-of-memory scenarios.\n- Modifying Cloud Monitoring's rollout automation so that it automatically spots problems of this type, allowing engineers to be alerted sooner.",

The issue persisted for 11 hours, 20 minutes.\nAll customers in the United States who use credit card billing were inadvertently notified via email “Your payment information could not be processed. Visit the payment overview page to make sure your payment information is up to date and to pay any outstanding charges.” Customers also received a notification alert in the Google Cloud Console to update their primary payment method. After customers attempted to update their payment information in the admin console, they received a message that the payment could not be processed.\nWe sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused by the incorrect notification to our customers. Our engineering team has deployed a fix for this and has ensured that account settings are restored. We are taking additional steps to prevent similar problems in the future, as outlined below.\nRoot Cause\nThe trigger for this service disruption was an update to the payment configuration intended to support virtual credit cards (one-time credit card numbers from Visa and MasterCard). This update unintentionally caused a situation in which no credit card payments were able to be processed in the U.S. region and resulted in payment failure notifications being sent out to affected customers. Google's standard change control policy is to roll out all production updates progressively; however, in this specific case, errors in the rollout process meant that the change rolled out much more rapidly. Addressing this is a key part of our corrective actions.\nRemediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue on 22 September 2021 15:28 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Engineers identified an unexpected increase of payment request failures and initiated a rollback of the configuration change at 17:42, which resolved the issue causing the incorrect email notifications as well as the Cloud Console alert notifications.\nOnce it was confirmed that affected customers were no longer prompted with the notification alert and impact had ended, engineers began mitigation work to update account state back to the proper payment settings to prevent a recurrence.\nTo prevent recurrence and reduce the impact of similar events, we are taking the following actions:\nImproving our payments infrastructure monitoring and alerting configuration with “early indicator” signals for faster detection and notification of widespread payment failures.\nSpeeding up payment system mitigation procedures by automating the root causing of problems, and increasing the rate at which recovery steps can be processed.\nEnsuring that the class of change which resulted in this incident is pushed progressively, with time to detect adverse impact at small scope.\nDetailed Description of Impact\n#### Google Cloud Console - Google Cloud Platform and Geo Maps\nU.S. customer accounts received an alert notification in their admin account warning that they needed to verify their payment method. When attempting to update the preferred credit card method, the user interface was unresponsive.\nCustomers received an email warning message informing them they needed to verify their payment method. They also might have received an email warning that their project was going to be suspended. After the issue was resolved, account alert notifications disappeared, and the account state was set back to the proper payments setting. Some customers may have observed restrictions and were unable to create new resources. These restrictions were corrected when the account was returned to good standing.\nThe period of impact was between 14:10 and 00:30.\n#### Google Admin Console - Google Workspace\nU.S. customer accounts received an alert notification in their admin account warning that they needed to verify their payment method. When attempting to update the preferred credit card method, the user interface was unresponsive.\nCustomers received an email warning they needed to verify their payment method. When they attempted to update the credit card they are currently using, they were unable to do so.

Affected instances may have lost telemetry data, and HA instances failed over if the primary was in the affected zone.\n- Google Cloud Storage experienced elevated read errors of up to 2.3% in europe-west2.\n- Cloud Filestore instances within europe-west2-c may have been unreachable.\n- Cloud MemoryStore instances within europe-west2 may have been unreachable.\n- Cloud Monitoring experienced delayed or missing metrics from resources in the zone.\n- Cloud VPN experienced a short duration where tunnels went down for a short time before being reestablished.",

The Pubsub issue also caused issues with Google Cloud Functions deployments and affected related Google Cloud Dataflow streaming jobs and watermarks. From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was an unhealthy task in our Pubsub change notification system that created a feedback loop with increased errors on backlog stats which scaled up more tasks and put more load on our Pubsub change notification system. Google Cloud Dataflow Streaming jobs that interact with PubSub were stalled due to the dependency of those jobs on Backlog Stats which are required to calculate the watermark.\n**Customer Impact:**\n- Google Cloud Pubsub - Users experienced latencies creating subscriptions and viewing their backlog status data such as how many messages they have in the queue to be received and acknowledged and how old is the oldest unacknowledged message)\n- Google Cloud Functions - Users experienced issues with deployments.\n- Google Cloud Dataflow - Streaming jobs that interact with PubSub stalled and experienced lagging watermarks.",

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Support by opening a case using https://cloud.google.com/support.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 23 August 2021 19:50\n**Incident End:** 23 August 2021 21:20\n**Duration:** 1 hours, 30 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\n- Cloud Networking\n- Cloud L7 and L4 Load balancers\n- Cloud Interconnect\n- Cloud NAT\n- Cloud VPN\n- Google Compute Engine\n- Google Kubernetes Engine\n- Cloud Persistent Disk\n- Cloud Cloud Storage\n- Cloud FileStore\n- Cloud Dataproc\n- Cloud Run\n- Cloud SQL\n- Cloud Spanner\n- Cloud Pub/Sub\n- Cloud Dataflow\n- Cloud Dataproc\n- Cloud Firestore\n- Cloud Bigtable\n- Cloud Logging\n- Cloud Monitoring\n- Cloud BigQuery\n- Cloud IAM\n**Regions/Zones:** australia-southeast2\n**Description:**\nGoogle Cloud Networking experienced intermittent connectivity issues with Google Cloud Services in australia-southeast2 for 1 hour and 30 minutes. The underlying Cloud Networking impact ended at 20:41, however, some Cloud Services took longer to recover - delaying the all clear until 21:20. Any service that uses Cloud Networking may have seen impact. We have included available details of service specific impact below; however, this may not be a comprehensive accounting of all downstream networking impact. From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was transient voltage at the feeder to the network equipment, causing the equipment to reboot. In order to mitigate the issue, traffic within the australia-southeast2 region was redirected temporarily.\n**Customer Impact:**\n- Cloud Networking: Public IP traffic connectivity failed from 19:51 to 20:41.\n- Cloud L7 Load Balancers: Partial dataplane query loss and control plane operational delay for External load balancers from 19:50 - 20:12, and Internal load balancers from 19:50 - 20:18.\n- Cloud L4 Load Balancing Inbound public IP traffic was dropped from 19:51 to 20:41.\n- Cloud Interconnect: Up to 100% packet loss between 19:50 and 20:21.\n- Cloud NAT experienced control plane failures from 19:51 to 20:00.\n- Cloud VPN HA dropped up to 83% of traffic between 19:51 and 20:21, while Legacy VPN dropped ~100% of traffic between 19:51 and 20:41.\n- Cloud SQL: 100% error rate from 19:49 to 20:01.\n- Cloud Storage: 100% error rate through 21:20.\n- Cloud Functions:\n- Cloud Run: 100% error rate through 21:19.\n- Cloud Bigtable: 100% error rate from 19:49 to 20:01 and increased latency from 20:01 to 20:13.\n- Cloud Logging: Logs written within the region may have failed to be ingested from 20:07 to 21:18.\n- Cloud Monitoring: Customers may have experienced falsely firing alerts, missed alerts, missing metrics and failed writes from 19:50 to 20:15.\n- Google Compute Engine: Operations to create or modify instances failed from 19:52 to 20:12. Connectivity from instances to other GCP services may be affected until 20:26. Existing instances may have lost network connectivity. Additionally autoscaling had delays or errors collecting input data which may have impacted autoscaling decisions.\n- Google Kubernetes Engine: Control plane operations on regional clusters failed between 19:50 and 20:04. Increased latency from 20:05 to 20:41. 100% of requests to container.googleapis.com failed\n- Persistent Disk: Up to 100% device unavailability between 19:51 and 20:13.\n- Cloud Filestore: Up to 100% error rate from 19:50 to 20:03.\n- Cloud IAM: ~80% error rate from 19:52 to 20:10.\n- Cloud Spanner: 100% error rate between 19:53 and 20:09.\n- Cloud Pub/Sub: Increased error rate and latency of up to 95% between 19:50 and 20:12.\n- Cloud Dataflow: Increased errors starting jobs and making progress on existing jobs between 19:50 and 20:12.\n- Cloud Dataproc: New cluster creation failed from 20:09 until 21:20\n- Cloud Firestore: Control Plane saw ~90% error rates from 19:50 to 20:03.
