From the preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue is a rollout on the configuration management system that manages and pushes configuration for multiple Google infrastructure systems. The roll out caused an increase in the task counts which overloaded the configuration management system as all tasks pulled the configuration at the same time.\n**Customer Impact:**\n* Affected customers would have experienced delays in creating or modifying the configuration of Global External HTTP(S) load balancers, Cloud Armor and Cloud CDN.\n* App Engine Flexible apps might have failed to deploy.",

Affected customers may have experienced high latency, high retransmits and elevated errors.\nWe would like to apologize for the length and severity of this incident. We are taking immediate steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future.\n[1] - https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/edge-locations\n**Root Cause**\nGoogle’s wide-area network is primarily comprised of infrastructure owned and operated by Google, although some physical links use fiber infrastructure which is owned and operated by third parties. Google has multiple resilient fiber paths and network points of presence serving users in Mexico.\nMultiple simultaneous fiber cuts on diversely-routed paths, at the same time as a planned maintenance event on another diversely-routed path, resulted in a capacity shortfall in Google’s wide-area network between Queretaro, Mexico and the United States. This multiple failure event represents a rare case in which the resulting capacity shortfall was visible to Google's users.\nTraffic was subsequently redirected to alternate links; however, there was insufficient capacity to serve all the redirected traffic, resulting in packet loss for user-facing network traffic to Google from users in Mexico.\n**Remediation and Prevention**\nGoogle’s automated repair mechanism detected the congestion on Tuesday, 22 March 2022, at 15:42 US/Pacific and redirected the traffic through alternate edge locations. However, the alternate link did not have sufficient capacity to serve all the redirected traffic, resulting in packet loss. The congestion was cleared when traffic was manually routed around the failed links on Tuesday, 22 March 2022, at 17:15 US/Pacific.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. However, this incident was the result of multiple concurrent failures on links which are designed to provide resilience; such failures, whilst very rare, are expected at a low frequency. We are taking the following steps to ensure we respond quickly to similar events in the future:\n* Improving the reliability of tooling that manually reroutes traffic in extreme multiple-failure scenarios.\n* Improving the diagnostic systems that help Google's Cloud Networking teams decide how to deal with extreme multiple-failure scenarios.\nWe appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.\n**Detailed Description of Impact**\nOn Tuesday, 22 March 2022 from 15:30 to 17:15 US/Pacific, customers reaching Google services from Mexico may have experienced network slowness and packet loss, and errors returned from our services.

The issue was identified and mitigated automatically by 15:28 US/Pacific.\nWe understand this issue has affected our valued customers and users, and we apologize to those who were affected.\n**Root Cause**\nGoogle’s production backbone is a global network that enables connectivity for all user-facing traffic via Points of Presence (POPs) or internet exchanges.\nA rare hardware failure of a component on the fiber paths from one of the transpacific gateway campuses in Google’s production backbone led to a decrease in available network bandwidth between the gateway and multiple edge locations, causing packet loss.\n**Remediation and Prevention**\nGoogle’s automated repair mechanisms detected the decrease in available network bandwidth on Friday, 18 March 2022 at 15:20 US/Pacific and automatically routed the traffic through alternate links. The traffic rerouting completed on Friday, 18 March 2022 at 15:28 US/Pacific, mitigating the issue.\nWhile our automated mechanisms worked as intended and recovered the traffic without manual intervention, we understand that the scope of impact caused by this rare event affected our customers. We have been working on optimizing our global network to minimize the time spent automatically reconfiguring around failures like this (known as \"convergence time\"). While we have made progress, efforts to improve still further remain ongoing. We continue to ensure that the current technology is optimally configured to minimize the frequency and severity of these issues.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions.

The issue was identified and mitigated automatically by 15:28 US/Pacific.\nWe understand this issue has affected our valued customers and users, and we apologize to those who were affected.\n**Root Cause**\nGoogle’s production backbone is a global network that enables connectivity for all user-facing traffic via Points of Presence (POPs) or internet exchanges.\nA rare hardware failure of a component on the fiber paths from one of the transpacific gateway campuses in Google’s production backbone led to a decrease in available network bandwidth between the gateway and multiple edge locations, causing packet loss.\n**Remediation and Prevention**\nGoogle’s automated repair mechanisms detected the decrease in available network bandwidth on Friday, 18 March 2022 at 15:20 US/Pacific and automatically routed the traffic through alternate links. The traffic rerouting completed on Friday, 18 March 2022 at 15:28 US/Pacific, mitigating the issue.\nWhile our automated mechanisms worked as intended and recovered the traffic without manual intervention, we understand that the scope of impact caused by this rare event affected our customers. We have been working on optimizing our global network to minimize the time spent automatically reconfiguring around failures like this (known as \"convergence time\"). While we have made progress, efforts to improve still further remain ongoing. We continue to ensure that the current technology is optimally configured to minimize the frequency and severity of these issues.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions. We appreciate your patience and apologize again for the impact to your organization. We thank you for your business.\n**Detailed Description of Impact**\nCustomers may have observed packet loss for traffic routed via transpacific links on Google's backbone. This could include traffic from or to any of the following cloud regions:\n* asia-east1\n* asia-northeast1\n* asia-northeast2\n* asia-northeast3\n* asia-southeast1\n* asia-southeast2\n* australia-southeast1\n* australia-southeast2\n* us-west1\n* us-central1\n* us-east1\n* us-east4\n* northamerica-northeast1\n* europe-west1\n* europe-west2\n* europe-west3\n* europe-west4\n* europe-west6\n* europe-west8\n* europe-west9\n* europe-central2\n* europe-north1",

To our Traffic Director customers who were impacted during this service disruption, we sincerely apologize. We have conducted an internal investigation and are taking steps to improve our service.\n**Root Cause**\nTraffic Director has a configuration pipeline that distributes customer configurations to Traffic Director infrastructure globally. The configuration pipeline has been undergoing a multi-stage, multi-year architectural rewrite to address a number of limitations in the previous architecture. One step to move to the new architecture has been to migrate existing Traffic Director configurations to a different format. This data migration has been ongoing since November 2021. The Traffic Director code was updated to handle both old and new formats of the configuration.\nThe data format migration was not fully completed; it encountered sporadic failures that were believed to only affect test configurations of new unreleased features. These failures masked the true completion state for full migration of all customer data. As a result, some customer data was an inconsistent state of old and new formats.\nOn 8 March 2022 at 10:05 PT, a change to the Traffic Director code that processes the configuration was updated. The code change assumed that the configuration data format migration was fully completed. In fact, the data migration had not completed. The failures were believed to only affect test configurations of new unreleased features, but they also affected a certain set of customer configurations that met all of the following criteria:\n1. The project was part of a Shared VPC.\n2. The project had at least one configuration migrated to the new format, which would be true if: a. The customer modified the project configuration after 12 November 2021; or b. The internal migration tool successfully processed the configuration.\n3. The project had at least one configuration that was not migrated to the new format: a. The customer had not modified the project since 12 November 2021; or b.The internal migration tool failed to process the configuration.\n4. The hostname of interest was part of the migrated configuration or the data plane requested configuration from the Traffic Director based on the migrated configuration.\nIt would inadvertently delete the configurations which caused the downstream clients to lose their programming and deconfigure the data plane.\nThe change was rolled back, the configurations were recovered, and service was restored for all users.\n**Remediation and Prevention**\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue through a customer support case on 8 March 2022 at 10:24 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation.\nOnce the nature and scope of the issue became clear, Google engineers rolled back the Traffic Director configuration rollout to prevent additional customer impact.\nAt 12:42 US/Pacific, engineers forced a reprogramming of configurations, which mitigated the issue.\nWe sincerely apologize for the length and severity of this incident. Our team at Google is taking immediate steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future.\n**Detailed Description of Impact**\nOn Tuesday, 8 March 2022 from 10:07 to 12:42 US/Pacific, customers using Traffic Director-managed backends experienced elevated service errors. Affected customers would have seen their Traffic Director managed clients deprogrammed as the configuration was removed. The effect of the deprogramming for users behind Google Cloud Load Balancers (GCLB) would have been visible as 500 errors. Some affected customers were able to mitigate the issue for themselves through the workaround of moving to backends that were not Traffic Director managed.",

        "text": "# UPDATED INCIDENT REPORT\n## Summary\nOn Saturday, 8 January 2022, multiple GCP products in us-west1-b experienced increased network latency for a duration of 3 hours and 22 minutes. To our affected customers in us-west1-b who were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nGoogle leverages \"Software-defined Networking” (SDN) to simplify and automate the growth and expansion of our data center networks. This allows us to dynamically scale up data center networks to meet customer demand. This outage began when a routine maintenance event was performed on one of the SDN components. This maintenance event triggered an application failover that prompted a newly active replica to perform reconciliation from a previous checkpoint. These events are expected to be seamless and cause no network disruption. However, the checkpoint data was incorrectly missing a particular piece of configuration information; this was propagated to ~15% of the network switches serving us-west1-b.\nSeconds after this event, the SDN automatically corrected the incomplete configuration. Reprogramming of the affected switches triggered a race condition within the switch firmware, eventually causing them to crash. Automatic repair and mitigation actions were invoked within 10 minutes of switches failing. However, the unexpectedly large number, and network proximity, of the failures prevented a fully automatic recovery. As such, the outage was not mitigated until on-call engineers manually recovered the affected switches. The corrupted checkpoint data was only present in a single location and therefore no other cloud zone was ever at risk.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nThe outage was detected by Google Engineers on Saturday, 8 January at 15:25 US/Pacific, who immediately started an investigation. At 16:03, engineers tried to migrate traffic away from the impacted switches in the switch fabric, but this did not resolve the issue. At 17:19, engineers ascertained that the impacted switches needed to have their services restarted, and at 17:37, they began to do so. The network issue was mitigated at 18:00, when enough switches had been restarted to successfully serve all network traffic. The issue was fully resolved by 18:36, when all services were marked as recovered.\nThe conditions that caused this disruption existed only in a small subset of Google's network. The function responsible for causing it has been disabled and will not be reenabled until the steps below have been fully implemented.\n1. Avoiding the trigger: - We have audited and disabled the SDN feature that triggered this incident. - We have identified test coverage gaps in our SDN release process, which will be addressed to prevent a repeat of this and other similar issues. - Our systems will be modified to validate SDN checkpoint data before it is persisted for later recovery. - Our SDN maintenance workflow safety checks will be enhanced to automatically stop the workflow during an outage.\n2. Ensure changes are applied to the SDN more progressively: - We will redistribute SDN services to limit the areas impacted by failed maintenance workflows. - We will be developing new SDN safety components that validate potentially disruptive operations by applying them to network devices that are similarly configured, but not currently active, before deploying them further.\n3. Reduce time to resolution: - We will improve network management tooling to simplify and expedite mass switch recovery. - We will deploy monitoring improvements to more quickly identify broad network switch failures.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Saturday, 8 January from 15:15 to 18:36 US/Pacific:\n#### Cloud Router\nAffected Cloud Router customers would have experienced elevated packet loss from 40% to 100%.\n#### Cloud VPN\nAffected Cloud VPN customers would have experienced elevated packet loss from 40% to 100%.\n#### Cloud DNS\nCloud DNS customers experienced increased latency and errors on DNS requests.\n#### Cloud AI\nCloud AI customers experienced elevated latency on prediction requests.\n#### Cloud Run\nCloud Run customers experienced network connectivity issues.\n#### Cloud Spanner\nCloud Spanner Customers experienced elevated latency.\n#### Google Compute Engine\nGoogle Compute Engine customers experienced network latency, connectivity issues and slow input/output (I/O) operations on disks due to network latency, which may have manifested as unresponsive Compute Engine instances, including Google Kubernetes instances.\n#### Other Services\nOther services that require Google Cloud Networking in us-west1-b were also affected. Customers would experience latency, errors, and delays.",

At 16:03, engineers tried to migrate traffic away from the impacted switches in the switch fabric, but this did not resolve the issue. At 17:19 engineers ascertained that the impacted switches needed to have their services restarted, and at 17:37 they began to do so. The network issue was mitigated at 18:00 when enough switches had been restarted to successfully serve all network traffic. The issue was fully resolved by 18:36 when all services were marked as recovered.\nWe are still working on the details of steps to avert further issues of this type, which in line with Google’s standard practice, are being designed to ensure the following:\n- Prevention of a reoccurrence of an outage of this nature.\n- Detection and mitigation of similar, future outages more quickly.\nThe conditions that caused this disruption existed only in a small part of the network. The function responsible for causing it has been disabled and will not be re-enabled until the steps above have been fully implemented.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Saturday, 8 January from 15:15 to 18:36 US/Pacific:\n#### Cloud Router\nAffected Cloud Router customers would have experienced elevated packet loss from 40% to 100%.\n#### Cloud VPN\nAffected Cloud VPN customers would have experienced elevated packet loss from 40% to 100%.\n#### Cloud DNS\nCloud DNS customers experienced increased latency and errors on DNS requests.\n#### Cloud AI\nCloud AI customers experienced elevated latency on prediction requests.\n#### Cloud Run\nCloud Run customers experienced network connectivity issues.\n#### Cloud Spanner\nCloud Spanner Customers experienced elevated latency.\n#### Google Compute Engine\nGoogle Compute Engine customers experienced network latency, connectivity issues and slow input/output (I/O) operations on disks due to network latency, which may have manifested as unresponsive Compute Engine instances, including Google Kubernetes instances.\n#### Other Services\nOther services that require Google Cloud Networking in us-west1-b were also affected.

      "text": "# UPDATED INCIDENT REPORT\n## Summary\nOn Saturday, 8 January 2022, multiple GCP products in us-west1-b experienced increased network latency for a duration of 3 hours and 22 minutes. To our affected customers in us-west1-b who were impacted during this outage, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\n## Root Cause\nGoogle leverages \"Software-defined Networking” (SDN) to simplify and automate the growth and expansion of our data center networks. This allows us to dynamically scale up data center networks to meet customer demand. This outage began when a routine maintenance event was performed on one of the SDN components. This maintenance event triggered an application failover that prompted a newly active replica to perform reconciliation from a previous checkpoint. These events are expected to be seamless and cause no network disruption. However, the checkpoint data was incorrectly missing a particular piece of configuration information; this was propagated to ~15% of the network switches serving us-west1-b.\nSeconds after this event, the SDN automatically corrected the incomplete configuration. Reprogramming of the affected switches triggered a race condition within the switch firmware, eventually causing them to crash. Automatic repair and mitigation actions were invoked within 10 minutes of switches failing. However, the unexpectedly large number, and network proximity, of the failures prevented a fully automatic recovery. As such, the outage was not mitigated until on-call engineers manually recovered the affected switches. The corrupted checkpoint data was only present in a single location and therefore no other cloud zone was ever at risk.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nThe outage was detected by Google Engineers on Saturday, 8 January at 15:25 US/Pacific, who immediately started an investigation. At 16:03, engineers tried to migrate traffic away from the impacted switches in the switch fabric, but this did not resolve the issue. At 17:19, engineers ascertained that the impacted switches needed to have their services restarted, and at 17:37, they began to do so. The network issue was mitigated at 18:00, when enough switches had been restarted to successfully serve all network traffic. The issue was fully resolved by 18:36, when all services were marked as recovered.\nThe conditions that caused this disruption existed only in a small subset of Google's network. The function responsible for causing it has been disabled and will not be reenabled until the steps below have been fully implemented.\n1. Avoiding the trigger: - We have audited and disabled the SDN feature that triggered this incident. - We have identified test coverage gaps in our SDN release process, which will be addressed to prevent a repeat of this and other similar issues. - Our systems will be modified to validate SDN checkpoint data before it is persisted for later recovery. - Our SDN maintenance workflow safety checks will be enhanced to automatically stop the workflow during an outage.\n2. Ensure changes are applied to the SDN more progressively: - We will redistribute SDN services to limit the areas impacted by failed maintenance workflows. - We will be developing new SDN safety components that validate potentially disruptive operations by applying them to network devices that are similarly configured, but not currently active, before deploying them further.\n3. Reduce time to resolution: - We will improve network management tooling to simplify and expedite mass switch recovery. - We will deploy monitoring improvements to more quickly identify broad network switch failures.\n## Detailed Description of Impact\nOn Saturday, 8 January from 15:15 to 18:36 US/Pacific:\n#### Cloud Router\nAffected Cloud Router customers would have experienced elevated packet loss from 40% to 100%.\n#### Cloud VPN\nAffected Cloud VPN customers would have experienced elevated packet loss from 40% to 100%.\n#### Cloud DNS\nCloud DNS customers experienced increased latency and errors on DNS requests.\n#### Cloud AI\nCloud AI customers experienced elevated latency on prediction requests.\n#### Cloud Run\nCloud Run customers experienced network connectivity issues.\n#### Cloud Spanner\nCloud Spanner Customers experienced elevated latency.\n#### Google Compute Engine\nGoogle Compute Engine customers experienced network latency, connectivity issues and slow input/output (I/O) operations on disks due to network latency, which may have manifested as unresponsive Compute Engine instances, including Google Kubernetes instances.\n#### Other Services\nOther services that require Google Cloud Networking in us-west1-b were also affected.

Thank you for your patience and understanding as we worked to resolve the issue.\nWe want to share some information about what happened and the steps we are taking to ensure this issue doesn’t occur again. We also want to assure you that this service disruption does not have any bearing on our preparedness or platform reliability going into Black Friday/Cyber Monday (BFCM).\n## Incident Summary\nOn Tuesday, 16 November 2021 at 09:35 PT, Google Cloud Networking experienced issues with the Google External Proxy Load Balancing (GCLB) service. Affected customers received Google 404 errors in response to HTTP/S requests.\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue via automated alerting at 09:50 PT, which aligned with incoming customer support requests, and we immediately started to mitigate the issue by rolling back to the last known good configuration.\nBetween 09:35 and 10:08 PT, customers affected by the outage may have encountered 404 errors when accessing any web page (URL) served by Google External Proxy Load Balancing.\nA rollback to the last known good configuration completed at 10:08 PT, which resolved the 404 errors. To avoid the risk of a recurrence, our engineers suspended customer-initiated configuration changes in GCLB. As a result, GCLB service customers were unable to make changes to their load balancing configuration between 10:04 and 11:28 PT.\nDuring the change suspension period, we validated the fix to safeguard against recurrence and deployed additional proctoring and monitoring to ensure safe resumption of service.\nBy 11:28 PT, customer configuration pushes resumed, and normal service was restored. The total duration of impact was 1 hour and 53 minutes.\n## Root Cause\nThis incident was caused by a bug in the configuration pipeline that propagates customer configuration rules to GCLB. The bug was introduced 6 months ago and allowed a race condition (when behavior depends on the timing of data accesses) that would, in very rare cases, push a corrupted configuration file to GCLB. The GCLB update pipeline contains extensive validation checks to prevent corrupt configurations, but the race condition was one that could corrupt the file near the end of the pipeline.\nA Google engineer discovered this bug on 12 November, which caused us to declare an internal high-priority incident because of the latent risk to production systems. After analyzing the bug, we froze a part of our configuration system to make the likelihood of the race condition even lower. Since the race condition had existed in the fleet for several months already, the team believed that this extra step made the risk even lower. Thus the team believed the lowest-risk path, especially given the proximity to BFCM, was to roll out fixes in a controlled manner as opposed to a same-day emergency patch.\nWe developed two mitigations: patch A closed the race condition itself; and patch B added additional input validation to the binary receiving the configuration to prevent it from accepting the new configuration, even if the race condition occurred.\nBoth patches were ready and verified to fix the problem by 13 November. Gradual rollouts of both patches started on Monday, 15 November, and patch B completed rollout by that evening. On Tuesday, 16 November, as the patch A rollout was within 30 minutes of completing, the race condition did manifest in an unpatched cluster, and the outage started.\nAdditionally, even though patch B did protect against the kind of input errors observed during testing, the actual race condition produced a different form of error in the configuration, which the completed rollout of patch B did not prevent from being accepted.\nOnce the root cause was identified, our engineers mitigated the issue by restoring a known-good configuration, and completed and verified the fix, which eliminates the risk of recurrence.\n## Service(s) Affected:\n- Google Cloud Networking: Customer HTTP/S endpoints served 404 error pages. During partial recovery, traffic was served, but customers were unable to make changes to their load balancer configurations.\n- GCLB can be used to load balance traffic to a number of other Google Cloud services, which lost traffic because of the outage. Customers who use serverless network endpoint groups on GCLB as a frontend to Google Cloud Run, Google App Engine, Google App Engine Flex, or Google Cloud Functions received 404 errors when attempting to access their service. Customers using Apigee, Firebase, or Google App Engine Flex received 404 errors when attempting to access their service.\n## Zone(s) Affected:\nGlobal\n## How Customers Experienced the Issue:\nBetween 09:35 and 10:08 PT, most endpoints served by global GCLB load balancers returned a 404 error. For an additional 1 hour and 20 minutes, customers were unable to make changes to their load balancing configuration.\n## Workaround(s):\nNone.\nService was restored on 16 November 2021 at 11:28 PT, and the Google Cloud Status Dashboard was updated by 12:08 PT to reflect this.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nWe have fixed the underlying bug and are taking the following actions to prevent recurrence:\nWe immediately added additional alerting, which will notify us to similar issues significantly faster going forward.\nWe are adding safeguards to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. These safeguards provide strengthened automated correctness-checking to configurations before they are applied.\nWe are accelerating planned architectural changes that will improve how we isolate and resolve such issues in the future.",

From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was caused by a new infrastructure feature triggering a latent issue within internal network load balancer code.\n**Customer Impact:**\n* Google Cloud Console - Affected customers in Europe were unable to load the console, or experienced timeouts.\n* Container Registry - Affected customers were unable to connect to the service using the API in europe-west1.\n* Cloud Bigtable - Affected customers in Europe experienced unavailable errors and latency for both data and admin operations.\n* Cloud Spanner - Affected customers in Europe experienced unavailable errors and latency for both data and admin operations.\n* Cloud Endpoints - Service was unavailable in europe-west1 and europe-west4.\n* Firebase Messaging - Affected customers experienced issues receiving notifications in asia-southeast1.\n* Cloud SQL - Affected customers experienced probe creation request failures in europe-west1, europe-west4, and europe-west5.\n* Cloud Eventarc - Affected customers were unable to create triggers in europe-west1.\n* App Engine - Affected customers experienced elevated errors in europe-west1.\n**Additional details:**\nThe error was caught within 4 minutes by automated safety systems, and further spread was slowed at this point. The issue was fully mitigated approximately 1hr 44m later, when our engineering team completed a rollout to disable the vulnerable code path. The issue will be fully prevented going forward via a root cause fix, which will complete rollout by 12 November 2021 21:00 US/Pacific.",

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Support by opening a case using https://cloud.google.com/support.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 12 November 2021 00:30\n**Incident End:** 12 November 2021 02:14\n**Duration:** 1 hour 44 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\n* Cloud Developer Tools\n* Cloud Endpoints\n* Cloud Eventarc\n* Google App Engine\n* Google Cloud Bigtable\n* Google Cloud Console\n* Google Cloud Infrastructure Components\n* Google Cloud Networking\n* Google Cloud SQL\n* Operations\n**Regions/Zones:** Europe\n**Description:**\nGoogle’s Front End load balancing service experienced failures resulting in impact to several downstream Google Cloud services in Europe. From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was caused by a new infrastructure feature triggering a latent issue within internal network load balancer code.\n**Customer Impact:**\n* Google Cloud Console - Affected customers in Europe were unable to load the console, or experienced timeouts.\n* Container Registry - Affected customers were unable to connect to the service using the API in europe-west1.\n* Cloud Bigtable - Affected customers in Europe experienced unavailable errors and latency for both data and admin operations.\n* Cloud Spanner - Affected customers in Europe experienced unavailable errors and latency for both data and admin operations.\n* Cloud Endpoints - Service was unavailable in europe-west1 and europe-west4.\n* Firebase Messaging - Affected customers experienced issues receiving notifications in asia-southeast1.\n* Cloud SQL - Affected customers experienced probe creation request failures in europe-west1, europe-west4, and europe-west5.\n* Cloud Eventarc - Affected customers were unable to create triggers in europe-west1.\nApp Engine - Affected customers experienced elevated errors in europe-west1.\n**Additional details:**\nThe error was caught within 4 minutes by automated safety systems, and further spread was slowed at this point. The issue was fully mitigated approximately 1hr 44m later, when our engineering team completed a rollout to disable the vulnerable code path. The issue will be fully prevented going forward via a root cause fix, which will complete rollout by 12 November 2021 21:00 US/Pacific.",

If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Support by opening a case using https://cloud.google.com/support.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 02 November 2021 04:13\n**Incident End:** 16 December 2021 12:25\n**Duration:** 44 days, 8 hours, 12 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\nCloudSQL- MySQL instance migration.\n**Regions/Zones:** Global\n**Description:**\nCloudSQL experienced an issue with MySQL instance migration to 5.7.36 with source database gtid_mode set to ON for a duration of 44 days, 8 hours, 12 minutes. The root cause of the issue is a MySQL bug https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=105761 that may affect customers who migrated to MySQL version 5.7.36 on or after November 2nd 2021, from a source database that had gtid_mode set to ON.\n**Customer Impact:**\nCloud SQL External Server or Database Migration Service (DMS) users who migrated to Cloud SQL for MySQL 5.7.36, with replication using managed dumps may have experienced replication failures if they have insert/update/delete transactions during the dump phase. Furthermore, if updates were made to those jobs during the replication phase, the migration job may have failed.\nThe issue was observed when ALL the following conditions are met:\n* Cloud SQL MySQL version migrated to is 5.7.36.\n* Source database gtid_mode is ON.\n* Customer is running continuous migration (see DMS doc https://cloud.google.com/database-migration/docs/mysql/create-migration-job).\n* Customer is not migrating with a file, i.e. migration is using a managed dump.\nNew instances should not experience this issue, but please follow the below recommended workaround for existing instances that are impacted. We will be sending out targeted communications to the affected customers.\n***Workaround:*** Customers should start a new migration by dumping the data from a source database instance running MySQL 5.7.35 or lower versions to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) manually (Cloud SQL, DMS), using a mysqldump file, and then migrate using the dump file to Cloud SQL for MySQL 5.7.",

From preliminary analysis, the root cause was resource contention related to an unexpected increase in API operations.

From preliminary analysis, the root case was created by an unexpected increase of nodepool operations in a single customer cluster.

We apologize for the inconvenience and are taking steps toward preventing recurrence in the future.\n## Root Cause\nCloud Monitoring is a global service but is subdivided into internal locales, each of which collect monitoring data which is generated locally. When users query Cloud Monitoring, each query fans out through a series of nodes (called mixers) within the corresponding locales. The mixers reach out to source nodes to gather the appropriate data, temporarily retaining it within a limited set of memory.\nDuring a recent infrastructure change in the U.S. locale, the amount of memory allocated to mixers in the us-central1 region was inadvertently reduced. This caused mixer tasks to run low on memory. The number of tasks in a low memory state grew over a period of several days as the change was gradually rolled out to production, following Google's standard progressive rollout policies.\nThe mixer task has safeguards which are designed to detect and reduce the impact of low memory conditions by pausing queries that use significant memory. However, in this case, an existing misconfiguration of this safeguard prevented it from activating correctly. Eventually, tasks which were low on memory failed; enough tasks failed in total to cause widespread failures and service impact.\n## Remediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the problem on 19 October 2021 at 11:11 and immediately started an investigation. Root cause - the reduction in memory allocation for mixer nodes - was identified at 11:32. Google engineers quickly identified a mitigation, which we began to roll out at 11:50. Restoring the proper memory capacity for mixer nodes fully mitigated the issue at 12:54.\nGoogle is committed to quickly and continually improving our technology and operations to prevent service disruptions.\nWe are taking the following immediate steps to prevent this or similar issues from happening again:\n- Fixing the misconfiguration so that mixers which are low on memory will correctly detect that condition.\n- Introduce load-shedding, such that mixers which run out of memory will simply reject new queries until memory usage subsides, rather than failing.\n- Optimize the mixers to reduce the likelihood of out-of-memory scenarios.\n- Modifying Cloud Monitoring's rollout automation so that it automatically spots problems of this type, allowing engineers to be alerted sooner.",

        "text": "INCIDENT REPORT (Combined GCP / WS)\nSummary\nOn 22 September 2021 14:10 US/Pacific, Google Cloud, Workspace, and Geo (Maps) customers in the United States (U.S.) incorrectly received alert notifications on the Google Cloud Console user interface and an email regarding an issue with processing automatic payments. The issue persisted for 11 hours, 20 minutes.\nAll customers in the United States who use credit card billing were inadvertently notified via email “Your payment information could not be processed. Visit the payment overview page to make sure your payment information is up to date and to pay any outstanding charges.” Customers also received a notification alert in the Google Cloud Console to update their primary payment method. After customers attempted to update their payment information in the admin console, they received a message that the payment could not be processed.\nWe sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused by the incorrect notification to our customers. Our engineering team has deployed a fix for this and has ensured that account settings are restored. We are taking additional steps to prevent similar problems in the future, as outlined below.\nRoot Cause\nThe trigger for this service disruption was an update to the payment configuration intended to support virtual credit cards (one-time credit card numbers from Visa and MasterCard). This update unintentionally caused a situation in which no credit card payments were able to be processed in the U.S. region and resulted in payment failure notifications being sent out to affected customers. Google's standard change control policy is to roll out all production updates progressively; however, in this specific case, errors in the rollout process meant that the change rolled out much more rapidly. Addressing this is a key part of our corrective actions.\nRemediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue on 22 September 2021 15:28 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Engineers identified an unexpected increase of payment request failures and initiated a rollback of the configuration change at 17:42, which resolved the issue causing the incorrect email notifications as well as the Cloud Console alert notifications.\nOnce it was confirmed that affected customers were no longer prompted with the notification alert and impact had ended, engineers began mitigation work to update account state back to the proper payment settings to prevent a recurrence.\nTo prevent recurrence and reduce the impact of similar events, we are taking the following actions:\nImproving our payments infrastructure monitoring and alerting configuration with “early indicator” signals for faster detection and notification of widespread payment failures.\nSpeeding up payment system mitigation procedures by automating the root causing of problems, and increasing the rate at which recovery steps can be processed.\nEnsuring that the class of change which resulted in this incident is pushed progressively, with time to detect adverse impact at small scope.\nDetailed Description of Impact\n#### Google Cloud Console - Google Cloud Platform and Geo Maps\nU.S. customer accounts received an alert notification in their admin account warning that they needed to verify their payment method.

      "text": "INCIDENT REPORT (Combined GCP / WS)\nSummary\nOn 22 September 2021 14:10 US/Pacific, Google Cloud, Workspace, and Geo (Maps) customers in the United States (U.S.) incorrectly received alert notifications on the Google Cloud Console user interface and an email regarding an issue with processing automatic payments. The issue persisted for 11 hours, 20 minutes.\nAll customers in the United States who use credit card billing were inadvertently notified via email “Your payment information could not be processed. Visit the payment overview page to make sure your payment information is up to date and to pay any outstanding charges.” Customers also received a notification alert in the Google Cloud Console to update their primary payment method. After customers attempted to update their payment information in the admin console, they received a message that the payment could not be processed.\nWe sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused by the incorrect notification to our customers. Our engineering team has deployed a fix for this and has ensured that account settings are restored. We are taking additional steps to prevent similar problems in the future, as outlined below.\nRoot Cause\nThe trigger for this service disruption was an update to the payment configuration intended to support virtual credit cards (one-time credit card numbers from Visa and MasterCard). This update unintentionally caused a situation in which no credit card payments were able to be processed in the U.S. region and resulted in payment failure notifications being sent out to affected customers. Google's standard change control policy is to roll out all production updates progressively; however, in this specific case, errors in the rollout process meant that the change rolled out much more rapidly. Addressing this is a key part of our corrective actions.\nRemediation and Prevention\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue on 22 September 2021 15:28 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Engineers identified an unexpected increase of payment request failures and initiated a rollback of the configuration change at 17:42, which resolved the issue causing the incorrect email notifications as well as the Cloud Console alert notifications.\nOnce it was confirmed that affected customers were no longer prompted with the notification alert and impact had ended, engineers began mitigation work to update account state back to the proper payment settings to prevent a recurrence.\nTo prevent recurrence and reduce the impact of similar events, we are taking the following actions:\nImproving our payments infrastructure monitoring and alerting configuration with “early indicator” signals for faster detection and notification of widespread payment failures.\nSpeeding up payment system mitigation procedures by automating the root causing of problems, and increasing the rate at which recovery steps can be processed.\nEnsuring that the class of change which resulted in this incident is pushed progressively, with time to detect adverse impact at small scope.\nDetailed Description of Impact\n#### Google Cloud Console - Google Cloud Platform and Geo Maps\nU.S. customer accounts received an alert notification in their admin account warning that they needed to verify their payment method. When attempting to update the preferred credit card method, the user interface was unresponsive.\nCustomers received an email warning message informing them they needed to verify their payment method. They also might have received an email warning that their project was going to be suspended. After the issue was resolved, account alert notifications disappeared, and the account state was set back to the proper payments setting. Some customers may have observed restrictions and were unable to create new resources. These restrictions were corrected when the account was returned to good standing.\nThe period of impact was between 14:10 and 00:30.\n#### Google Admin Console - Google Workspace\nU.S. customer accounts received an alert notification in their admin account warning that they needed to verify their payment method.

In this case, the Pull Request Triggers – with comment control enabled – failed for some users with the ‘writer’ role. From preliminary analysis, the issue was caused by an unexpected response received from the GitHub collaborator API call used to validate user permissions.\n**Customer Impact:**\n- GCP builds failed to initiate when GitHub Pull Requests were created by users granted ‘write’ permissions on a repository via team permissions.\n- “Needs /gcbrun from a collaborator” error message was displayed after Triggers failed.\n**Additional details:**\n- The issue was mitigated after our engineering team rolled out a mitigation to unblock comment controlled triggers that are invoked by users with the ‘writer’ role.",

Please note, this information is based on our best knowledge at the time of posting and is subject to change as our investigation continues. If you have experienced impact outside of what is listed below, please reach out to Google Support by opening a case using https://cloud.google.com/support.\n(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 23 August 2021 19:50\n**Incident End:** 23 August 2021 21:20\n**Duration:** 1 hours, 30 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\n- Cloud Networking\n- Cloud L7 and L4 Load balancers\n- Cloud Interconnect\n- Cloud NAT\n- Cloud VPN\n- Google Compute Engine\n- Google Kubernetes Engine\n- Cloud Persistent Disk\n- Cloud Cloud Storage\n- Cloud FileStore\n- Cloud Dataproc\n- Cloud Run\n- Cloud SQL\n- Cloud Spanner\n- Cloud Pub/Sub\n- Cloud Dataflow\n- Cloud Dataproc\n- Cloud Firestore\n- Cloud Bigtable\n- Cloud Logging\n- Cloud Monitoring\n- Cloud BigQuery\n- Cloud IAM\n**Regions/Zones:** australia-southeast2\n**Description:**\nGoogle Cloud Networking experienced intermittent connectivity issues with Google Cloud Services in australia-southeast2 for 1 hour and 30 minutes. The underlying Cloud Networking impact ended at 20:41, however, some Cloud Services took longer to recover - delaying the all clear until 21:20. Any service that uses Cloud Networking may have seen impact. We have included available details of service specific impact below; however, this may not be a comprehensive accounting of all downstream networking impact. From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was transient voltage at the feeder to the network equipment, causing the equipment to reboot. In order to mitigate the issue, traffic within the australia-southeast2 region was redirected temporarily.\n**Customer Impact:**\n- Cloud Networking: Public IP traffic connectivity failed from 19:51 to 20:41.\n- Cloud L7 Load Balancers: Partial dataplane query loss and control plane operational delay for External load balancers from 19:50 - 20:12, and Internal load balancers from 19:50 - 20:18.\n- Cloud L4 Load Balancing Inbound public IP traffic was dropped from 19:51 to 20:41.\n- Cloud Interconnect: Up to 100% packet loss between 19:50 and 20:21.\n- Cloud NAT experienced control plane failures from 19:51 to 20:00.\n- Cloud VPN HA dropped up to 83% of traffic between 19:51 and 20:21, while Legacy VPN dropped ~100% of traffic between 19:51 and 20:41.\n- Cloud SQL: 100% error rate from 19:49 to 20:01.\n- Cloud Storage: 100% error rate through 21:20.\n- Cloud Functions:\n- Cloud Run: 100% error rate through 21:19.\n- Cloud Bigtable: 100% error rate from 19:49 to 20:01 and increased latency from 20:01 to 20:13.\n- Cloud Logging: Logs written within the region may have failed to be ingested from 20:07 to 21:18.\n- Cloud Monitoring: Customers may have experienced falsely firing alerts, missed alerts, missing metrics and failed writes from 19:50 to 20:15.\n- Google Compute Engine: Operations to create or modify instances failed from 19:52 to 20:12. Connectivity from instances to other GCP services may be affected until 20:26. Existing instances may have lost network connectivity. Additionally autoscaling had delays or errors collecting input data which may have impacted autoscaling decisions.\n- Google Kubernetes Engine: Control plane operations on regional clusters failed between 19:50 and 20:04. Increased latency from 20:05 to 20:41. 100% of requests to container.googleapis.com failed\n- Persistent Disk: Up to 100% device unavailability between 19:51 and 20:13.\n- Cloud Filestore: Up to 100% error rate from 19:50 to 20:03.\n- Cloud IAM: ~80% error rate from 19:52 to 20:10.\n- Cloud Spanner: 100% error rate between 19:53 and 20:09.\n- Cloud Pub/Sub: Increased error rate and latency of up to 95% between 19:50 and 20:12.\n- Cloud Dataflow: Increased errors starting jobs and making progress on existing jobs between 19:50 and 20:12.\n- Cloud Dataproc: New cluster creation failed from 20:09 until 21:20\n- Cloud Firestore: Control Plane saw ~90% error rates from 19:50 to 20:03.

During the incident, a workaround was provided which was to use the SSH SOCKS proxy as described in doc [2] to access the component gateway URLs.\n**Customer Impact:**\nGoogle Cloud Dataproc- Accessing component gateway URLs failed with 400 errors.\n**References:**\n[1] https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/accessing/dataproc-gateways#viewing_and_accessing_component_gateway_urls\n[2] https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/accessing/cluster-web-interfaces",

This issue impacted creation of resources that depend on PD-SSD. The root cause of the issue was an unexpected increase in utilization of PD-SSD, which led to unavailability of SSD capacity for some users in the impacted zones.\n**Customer Impact:**\n* Google Compute Engine (GCE) : * Issues with new VM creations as boot disk creations failed. * Auto-scaling of VMs was impacted due to failure with new VM creations. * Intermittent reduction in write throughput. * Issues with expanding SSD-backed device sizes.\n* Cloud Composer: * Failed Cloud Composer environment creations.\n* Cloud SQL: * Intermittent create operation failures. * PD-SSD disk size increases failures.\n* Cloud Build: * Cloud Builds using custom size VMs or using workerpools experienced failures.\n* Google Kubernetes Engine: * Intermittent issues with cluster creation. * Intermittent issues with creation and scaling of node pools with PD-SSD nodes.\n* Dataproc/Dataflow: * Dataproc cluster creation and Dataflow jobs may have failed due to underlying errors regarding disk creation failures.\n**Additional details:**\nTo prevent unexpected spike in utilization from impacting PD-SSD capacity availability, the following actions and safety measures were implemented:\n* Engineering team has identified and throttled the source of the unexpected spike in PD-SSD utilization.\n* Additional SSD capacity added for higher tolerance to spikes in utilization.\n* Increased rebalancing to make additional SSD capacity available.",

      "text": "(All Times US/Pacific)\n**Incident Start:** 19 June 2021 23:00\n**Incident End:** 23 June 2021 09:06\n**Duration:** 3 days, 10 hours, 6 minutes\n**Affected Services and Features:**\n* Google Compute Engine (GCE) - New Virtual Machine (VM) creations using PD SSD.\n* Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) - New cluster creations, node pools creation, scaling GKE node pools\n* Cloud Composer - Composer environment creations\n* Cloud SQL - Cluster creations\n* Dataproc - Cluster creations\n* Dataflow - Job creations\n* Cloud Build - Builds using custom size VMs or workerpools\n* Persistent Disk (PD) - New PD-SSD device creation\n**Regions/Zones:** us-east1-{a,b,c,d}, us-east4-{a,b}, us-west1-c and us-west4-a\n**Description:**\nMultiple Google Cloud services experienced intermittent problems with creating new Persistent Disk Solid-State Drive (PD-SSD) devices. This issue impacted creation of resources that depend on PD-SSD. The root cause of the issue was an unexpected increase in utilization of PD-SSD, which led to unavailability of SSD capacity for some users in the impacted zones.\n**Customer Impact:**\n* Google Compute Engine (GCE) : * Issues with new VM creations as boot disk creations failed. * Auto-scaling of VMs was impacted due to failure with new VM creations. * Intermittent reduction in write throughput. * Issues with expanding SSD-backed device sizes.\n* Cloud Composer: * Failed Cloud Composer environment creations.\n* Cloud SQL: * Intermittent create operation failures. * PD-SSD disk size increases failures.\n* Cloud Build: * Cloud Builds using custom size VMs or using workerpools experienced failures.\n* Google Kubernetes Engine: * Intermittent issues with cluster creation. * Intermittent issues with creation and scaling of node pools with PD-SSD nodes.\n* Dataproc/Dataflow: * Dataproc cluster creation and Dataflow jobs may have failed due to underlying errors regarding disk creation failures.\n**Additional details:**\nTo prevent unexpected spike in utilization from impacting PD-SSD capacity availability, the following actions and safety measures were implemented:\n* Engineering team has identified and throttled the source of the unexpected spike in PD-SSD utilization.\n* Additional SSD capacity added for higher tolerance to spikes in utilization.\n* Increased rebalancing to make additional SSD capacity available.",

        "text": "INCIDENT REPORT\n**Summary:**\nOn Thursday, May 20, 2021 at 05:25 US/Pacific, Google Cloud products experienced elevated latency and/or errors due to an issue with Access Control Lists (ACLs) intermittently for a duration of 10 hours and 45 minutes. The affected ACLs in this instance were internal that are used to define permissions for Google’s internal production resources. This prevented some internal service accounts from accessing various production jobs, which led to the downstream service impact. We apologize to our Cloud customers whose businesses were impacted during this disruption, and we are taking immediate action to improve the resiliency, performance, and availability of our services to avoid a recurrence.\n**Root Cause:**\nGoogle’s datacenters rely on Access Control Lists (ACLs) stored in a highly available lock service to perform operations, including validating permissions, activating new APIs, or creating new cloud resources. The access distribution manager, which maintains ACLs across Google production, encompasses both the control plane systems that allow for users to edit groups and the jobs which write the intended current state into the data plane, which is stored in a lock service as a set of signed ACL files.\nThe incident was triggered by a latent concurrency issue in a component of the production ACL system combined with a missing safety check, which led to truncation of ACLs across a subset of production. The safety mechanism for the legacy ACL components was inadvertently disabled by a change to update to the latest version in a subset of datacenters. The disabled safety checks in the legacy ACL component jobs allowed the invalid ACLs to be processed. The ACL component identified membership removals in the data snapshot and proceeded to remove ACL files from a backend locking service and passed the invalid ACLs to the backend stack, which correctly failed the safety checks.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue by automated alerting on 20 May 2021 at 05:55 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. At 06:07, engineers identified an incomplete data snapshot being written, and a safety check mechanism was unexpectedly removing group memberships. At 06:21, engineers began mitigation efforts to terminate ACL component jobs globally to prevent further impact. To identify the root cause, engineers compared jobs serving affected datacenters and verified they were served by legacy ACL components, while those which were not affected were served using the latest version of safety check flags. The next phase of the mitigation strategy was to restore most critical group memberships that were removed. Simultaneously, the failing ACL component jobs were being configured to apply the correct safety checks and prepared to restart to restore healthy memberships. By 07:32, engineers worked to repair and restore the legacy stack jobs to write the correct ACLs in impacted datacenters. By 07:44, we began manually restoring critical ACLs.\nBy 15:09, most of the production fleet was mitigated and engineers continued to restore the remaining ACLs. At 16:10, the ACL issues across production were fully mitigated.\nWe apologize for the length and severity of this incident. We are taking immediate steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future.\n**Detailed Description of Impact:**\nOn Thursday, May 20, 2021 from 05:25 to 16:10 US/Pacific, Google Cloud Infrastructure components experienced a service disruption which had varying degrees of impact to downstream services as described in detail below:\n**BigQuery**\nExperienced elevated error rates running queries and streaming in europe-west2. Around 5% of projects in the region were impacted with 0.63% failed query jobs and 3% of failed requests for streaming inserts from 06:10 to 07:30 PT.\n**Cloud Data Catalog**\nExperienced elevated error rates (30-40%) with permissions when reading backend databases in europe-west2 from 10:15 PT to 11:35 PT.\n**Cloud Logging**\nExperienced delayed logs in Google Cloud Storage (GCS) export pipeline in europe-west2 from 07:45 to 11:31 PT.\n**Cloud SQL**\nExperienced elevated error rates and latency on Admin APIs in the following regions from 06:51 to 09:44 PT: asia-south2, asia-southeast1, australia-southeast1, europe-north1, europe-west2, europe-west4, europe-west6, northamerica-northeast1, southamerica-east1, us-central1, us-central2, us-east1, us-east4, us-west1 and europe-west1. Among most impacted operations, instance creation (instances.insert) had an error ratio of 69%. Additionally, 10% of successful responses to instance.insert later experienced downstream creation failures. Changes to instance configs (instances.update and instances.patch) had 96% and 87% error rates respectively. Existing instances had no significant connectivity impact. Customers using gcloud sql to connect from new IP addresses that had not yet been added to the ACL, would have been unable to connect.\n**Cloud Bigtable**\nData API experienced elevated latency and error rates up to 10% in europe-west2 from 06:30 to 09:33 PT.\n**Cloud Dataproc**\nExperienced elevated latency of 95% with cluster creation and deletion in europe-west2.\n**Cloud Vertex AI**\nExperienced service degradation in europe-west2 which caused 15% of API requests to fail from 06:57 to 10:28 PT.\n**Cloud AI Platform**\nExperienced up to 100% widespread backend error rates in europe-west2 from 06:15 to 12:40 PT.\n**Cloud Dataflow**\nExperienced jobs stuck in a pending state; jobs were unable to be terminated or cancelled; jobs were unable to migrate backends which resulted in stuck progress; and streaming jobs experienced delays in europe-west2. 35% of projects were impacted in the region from 06:06 to 12:37 PT.\n**Cloud Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**\nUp to 75% of DLP worker tasks were down in europe-west2. 25% error rate averaged across all method types from 10:28 to 11:36 PT.\n**Google Compute Engine (GCE)**\nSome GCE APIs experienced degraded availability and elevated error rates up to 40% in europe-west2 and europe-west3. Customers also experienced delays in VM creation and deletion operations in us-west2-a from 06:50 to 11:48 PT.\n**Cloud Composer**\nExperienced composer environment creation and update operation failures up to 80% globally from 06:08 to 11:07 PT. Existing environments may have experienced service errors.\n**AppEngine Flexible**\nExperienced deployment failures with timeouts or reporting success globally. Approximately 21% of affected projects experienced 503 errors after deploying a new version, and approximately 79% of affected projects experienced deployment deadline exceeded errors from 05:45 to 09:30 PT.\n**Cloud Networking**\nCustomer initiated control plane config changes related to load balancing products were delayed globally from 05:28 PT to 09:15 PT. Creation or changes to existing Network Load Balancers were delayed in europe-west2 (from 06:20 to 10:05 PT) and europe-west3 (from 07:19 to 10:05 PT). Customers who didn't command config changes during the incident were not affected.\n**Cloud Armor**\nNew Cloud Armor configs were delayed globally from 05:35 to 09:15 PT.\n**Cloud Console**\nExperienced elevated error rates up to 100% while accessing some pages of the console. 2.82% of users were impacted globally from 07:03 to 10:00 PT.\n**Artifact Registry**\nExperienced errors for several HTTP-Maven/Docker and ScottyAgent requests in europe-west1 and australia-southeast1 from 06:20 - 09:45 PT.\n**Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**\nExperienced elevated “400” errors up to 95% which were mostly deadline exceeded errors for 3 hours in europe-west2 from 07:25 to 10:22 PT.\n**Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**\nCustomers were unable to create new clusters for around 2 hours in europe-west2 and europe-west3 from 08:20 to 10:10 PT.\n**Identity and Access Management (IAM)**\nEurope-west2: Checkpolicy <0.01% error rate (2-3 qps) from 6:02 to 11:33 PT\nGlobalization Expand RPC served elevated latency everywhere from 6:47 to 10:02 PT.\n**Persistent Disk (PD)**\nUp to 40% of device creation operations failed in us-west2, while approximately 1% of snapshot operations were delayed or failed in us-central1, us-east1, us-west-1, and northamerica-northeast2. Existing Persistent Disk devices were not impacted.\nIn addition to fixing the underlying cause, we will be implementing changes to prevent, reduce the impact of, and better communicate about this type of failure in several ways:\n- Enhancing safety checks of our underlying systems.\n- Adding additional mechanisms that allow Google engineers to rapidly determine and fix the root cause of the service disruption.\n- Improve regression testing for ACL components for error conditions.",

      "text": "INCIDENT REPORT\n**Summary:**\nOn Thursday, May 20, 2021 at 05:25 US/Pacific, Google Cloud products experienced elevated latency and/or errors due to an issue with Access Control Lists (ACLs) intermittently for a duration of 10 hours and 45 minutes. The affected ACLs in this instance were internal that are used to define permissions for Google’s internal production resources. This prevented some internal service accounts from accessing various production jobs, which led to the downstream service impact. We apologize to our Cloud customers whose businesses were impacted during this disruption, and we are taking immediate action to improve the resiliency, performance, and availability of our services to avoid a recurrence.\n**Root Cause:**\nGoogle’s datacenters rely on Access Control Lists (ACLs) stored in a highly available lock service to perform operations, including validating permissions, activating new APIs, or creating new cloud resources. The access distribution manager, which maintains ACLs across Google production, encompasses both the control plane systems that allow for users to edit groups and the jobs which write the intended current state into the data plane, which is stored in a lock service as a set of signed ACL files.\nThe incident was triggered by a latent concurrency issue in a component of the production ACL system combined with a missing safety check, which led to truncation of ACLs across a subset of production. The safety mechanism for the legacy ACL components was inadvertently disabled by a change to update to the latest version in a subset of datacenters. The disabled safety checks in the legacy ACL component jobs allowed the invalid ACLs to be processed. The ACL component identified membership removals in the data snapshot and proceeded to remove ACL files from a backend locking service and passed the invalid ACLs to the backend stack, which correctly failed the safety checks.\n**Remediation and Prevention:**\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the issue by automated alerting on 20 May 2021 at 05:55 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. At 06:07, engineers identified an incomplete data snapshot being written, and a safety check mechanism was unexpectedly removing group memberships. At 06:21, engineers began mitigation efforts to terminate ACL component jobs globally to prevent further impact. To identify the root cause, engineers compared jobs serving affected datacenters and verified they were served by legacy ACL components, while those which were not affected were served using the latest version of safety check flags. The next phase of the mitigation strategy was to restore most critical group memberships that were removed. Simultaneously, the failing ACL component jobs were being configured to apply the correct safety checks and prepared to restart to restore healthy memberships. By 07:32, engineers worked to repair and restore the legacy stack jobs to write the correct ACLs in impacted datacenters. By 07:44, we began manually restoring critical ACLs.\nBy 15:09, most of the production fleet was mitigated and engineers continued to restore the remaining ACLs. At 16:10, the ACL issues across production were fully mitigated.\nWe apologize for the length and severity of this incident. We are taking immediate steps to prevent a recurrence and improve reliability in the future.\n**Detailed Description of Impact:**\nOn Thursday, May 20, 2021 from 05:25 to 16:10 US/Pacific, Google Cloud Infrastructure components experienced a service disruption which had varying degrees of impact to downstream services as described in detail below:\n**BigQuery**\nExperienced elevated error rates running queries and streaming in europe-west2. Around 5% of projects in the region were impacted with 0.63% failed query jobs and 3% of failed requests for streaming inserts from 06:10 to 07:30 PT.\n**Cloud Data Catalog**\nExperienced elevated error rates (30-40%) with permissions when reading backend databases in europe-west2 from 10:15 PT to 11:35 PT.\n**Cloud Logging**\nExperienced delayed logs in Google Cloud Storage (GCS) export pipeline in europe-west2 from 07:45 to 11:31 PT.\n**Cloud SQL**\nExperienced elevated error rates and latency on Admin APIs in the following regions from 06:51 to 09:44 PT: asia-south2, asia-southeast1, australia-southeast1, europe-north1, europe-west2, europe-west4, europe-west6, northamerica-northeast1, southamerica-east1, us-central1, us-central2, us-east1, us-east4, us-west1 and europe-west1. Among most impacted operations, instance creation (instances.insert) had an error ratio of 69%. Additionally, 10% of successful responses to instance.insert later experienced downstream creation failures. Changes to instance configs (instances.update and instances.patch) had 96% and 87% error rates respectively. Existing instances had no significant connectivity impact. Customers using gcloud sql to connect from new IP addresses that had not yet been added to the ACL, would have been unable to connect.\n**Cloud Bigtable**\nData API experienced elevated latency and error rates up to 10% in europe-west2 from 06:30 to 09:33 PT.\n**Cloud Dataproc**\nExperienced elevated latency of 95% with cluster creation and deletion in europe-west2.\n**Cloud Vertex AI**\nExperienced service degradation in europe-west2 which caused 15% of API requests to fail from 06:57 to 10:28 PT.\n**Cloud AI Platform**\nExperienced up to 100% widespread backend error rates in europe-west2 from 06:15 to 12:40 PT.\n**Cloud Dataflow**\nExperienced jobs stuck in a pending state; jobs were unable to be terminated or cancelled; jobs were unable to migrate backends which resulted in stuck progress; and streaming jobs experienced delays in europe-west2. 35% of projects were impacted in the region from 06:06 to 12:37 PT.\n**Cloud Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**\nUp to 75% of DLP worker tasks were down in europe-west2. 25% error rate averaged across all method types from 10:28 to 11:36 PT.\n**Google Compute Engine (GCE)**\nSome GCE APIs experienced degraded availability and elevated error rates up to 40% in europe-west2 and europe-west3. Customers also experienced delays in VM creation and deletion operations in us-west2-a from 06:50 to 11:48 PT.\n**Cloud Composer**\nExperienced composer environment creation and update operation failures up to 80% globally from 06:08 to 11:07 PT. Existing environments may have experienced service errors.\n**AppEngine Flexible**\nExperienced deployment failures with timeouts or reporting success globally. Approximately 21% of affected projects experienced 503 errors after deploying a new version, and approximately 79% of affected projects experienced deployment deadline exceeded errors from 05:45 to 09:30 PT.\n**Cloud Networking**\nCustomer initiated control plane config changes related to load balancing products were delayed globally from 05:28 PT to 09:15 PT. Creation or changes to existing Network Load Balancers were delayed in europe-west2 (from 06:20 to 10:05 PT) and europe-west3 (from 07:19 to 10:05 PT). Customers who didn't command config changes during the incident were not affected.\n**Cloud Armor**\nNew Cloud Armor configs were delayed globally from 05:35 to 09:15 PT.\n**Cloud Console**\nExperienced elevated error rates up to 100% while accessing some pages of the console. 2.82% of users were impacted globally from 07:03 to 10:00 PT.\n**Artifact Registry**\nExperienced errors for several HTTP-Maven/Docker and ScottyAgent requests in europe-west1 and australia-southeast1 from 06:20 - 09:45 PT.\n**Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**\nExperienced elevated “400” errors up to 95% which were mostly deadline exceeded errors for 3 hours in europe-west2 from 07:25 to 10:22 PT.\n**Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**\nCustomers were unable to create new clusters for around 2 hours in europe-west2 and europe-west3 from 08:20 to 10:10 PT.\n**Identity and Access Management (IAM)**\nEurope-west2: Checkpolicy <0.01% error rate (2-3 qps) from 6:02 to 11:33 PT\nGlobalization Expand RPC served elevated latency everywhere from 6:47 to 10:02 PT.\n**Persistent Disk (PD)**\nUp to 40% of device creation operations failed in us-west2, while approximately 1% of snapshot operations were delayed or failed in us-central1, us-east1, us-west-1, and northamerica-northeast2. Existing Persistent Disk devices were not impacted.\nIn addition to fixing the underlying cause, we will be implementing changes to prevent, reduce the impact of, and better communicate about this type of failure in several ways:\n- Enhancing safety checks of our underlying systems.\n- Adding additional mechanisms that allow Google engineers to rapidly determine and fix the root cause of the service disruption.\n- Improve regression testing for ACL components for error conditions.",

This impacted Internet and Cloud Interconnect connectivity to/from us-west2, including traffic between GCE VMs in the region and Internet endpoints, VM-to-VM traffic over Public IPs, External Network Load Balancing, Cloud VPN Classic (non-HA), and Cloud Interconnect. Cloud VPN HA was not impacted.\n**Root cause and mitigation:**\nThe root cause was a rollout that changed some internal network settings on machines which handle internet routing to Cloud Services. Machines which received the change were unable to receive network programming information. The change caused new TCP connections to establish successfully, but dropped some packets sent between the Control and Data plane (Maglev[1]). Maglevs route traffic from public IPs and interconnects to various endpoints such as Cloud VPN tasks, individual instances, and groups of instances. When a Maglev task first starts, it must be programmed in order to start routing traffic. As independent Maglev Control and Dataplane rollouts restarted tasks, their long-standing TCP connections were reset, and the newly established connections were unable to exchange programming messages. This was mitigated by rolling back the configuration change once the root cause was identified.\n[1] https://research.google/pubs/pub44824\n**Customer Impact:**\n* There were two impact windows, with minor impact from 15:35 to 17:50, and major impact from 17:50 to 21:08.\n* GCE and GKE experienced up to 50% egress and ingress traffic loss in us-west2 for traffic over public IP. Internal IP traffic was not affected.\n* Cloud VPN Classic gateways experienced failure of up to 50% of tunnels.\n* Cloud HA VPN experienced no loss of connectivity for customers with properly configured redundant interfaces.\nInterface 0 of HA VPN gateways experienced up to 70% tunnel failure. Interface 1 was unaffected.\n* Cloud Interconnect experienced ~50% loss.\n* Google Cloud VMWare Engine was impacted where control plane services in the us-west2 region were not reachable by customers. In addition some customers whose VMWare Private Clouds were in the region may have experienced issues with some VMWare services not connecting to their cloud / on-premise networks and/or services.\n* Google services accessed over Interconnect or VPN (e.g. Google Private Access) would have experienced similar loss.\n* Customers using CloudSQL instances in us-west2 may have experienced failed queries or failed connection attempts during the outage.\n**Additional Details:**\n* The issue was mitigated by performing a full rollback of the changes.\n* We are working on improving the testbeds for this type of changes, as well as improvements of our monitoring and visibility for this type of interactions",
