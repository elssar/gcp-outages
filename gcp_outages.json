        "text": "# ISSUE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday 17 March 2021, Google Cloud Networking and Cloud Services that depend on Google's backbone network experienced a service disruption that resulted in increased latency, packet loss, and service unavailable errors for some services for a duration of 3 hours, 39 minutes. Cloud Interconnect had an extended impact duration of 4 hours, 30 minutes. We understand that this issue has impacted our valued customers and users, and we apologize to those who were affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n# ROOT CAUSE\r\n\r\nGoogle Cloud datacenters connect to Google’s global Backbone network through a datacenter edge networking stack that uses routers to bridge a region’s network with the global Backbone network. There are multiple roles that routers in Google networks have; some routers are dedicated to providing connectivity to the Google Backbone network, others are dedicated to providing aggregation for customer and peering routes. Google utilizes routers from multiple vendors to provide defense in depth in order to reduce impact for issues that affect a specific router vendor. \r\n\r\nThe trigger for this service disruption was a new set of routers being connected to Google’s backbone network as part of the normal router build process. The routers were part of a new network topology, this topology changed routes that some router roles received. This change in topology inadvertently caused the associated routes to be communicated to routers responsible for providing connectivity to the Google backbone, as well as aggregation routers. This triggered a defect in routers of a specific model, causing their routing process to fail. We previously communicated this defect was unknown; this is incorrect, as after further investigation we found that this defect was previously known, however it was not known to affect routers in these roles. During a routing failure these routers are configured to automatically redirect traffic away to minimize congestion and traffic loss, however, this results in some packet loss while the network reconverges onto new paths. This behavior worked as intended to reduce the potential impact of the issue, as repeated widespread routing process failures have the potential to create cascade failures in the backbone network.\r\n\r\n\r\n# REMEDIATION AND PREVENTION\r\n\r\nOnce the nature and scope of the problem became clear, Google engineers isolated the new set of routers from the network to prevent invalid routes being sent to the backbone routers. Once it was confirmed that affected routers were healthy and no longer had invalid routes, and impact for most services had ended, engineers began work to return traffic back to the routers that had rebooted. During this mitigation work to return traffic to a large number of routers, congestion caused a temporary period of increased loss and latency. Once the rebooted routers were back in the traffic path and the network had reconverged, the incident was considered mitigated.\r\n\r\nIn addition to fixing the underlying cause that resulted in invalid routes to trigger routing process failures on specific routers and repairing the bug in the vendor OS, we will be implementing changes to prevent and reduce the impact of this type of failure in several ways:\r\n\r\n1\\. Improve internal tooling for redirecting traffic from routers to reduce time to mitigation for issues with widespread network impact.\r\n\r\n2\\. Improve testing and release process of new router builds to ensure that topology changes for router roles are identified prior to being connected to the backbone network.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these changes, we are also working on long term architectural changes to help prevent issues of this type in the future. These changes will create well defined functional domains in the backbone network to allow for more consistent enforcement of route policies, limiting the scale of potential impact. These policies would provide better systematic protection against routes propagated through the network.\r\n\r\n\r\n# DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF IMPACT\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday 17 March 2021 from 08:20 to 12:50 US/Pacific, Google Cloud Networking increased latency, packet loss, and service unavailable errors for traffic between regions and from Google to external endpoints including on-premises environments and the public internet. The issue was mitigated when the source of the invalid routes was isolated by 11:00, and work to redirect traffic back to the affected routers began. During this time, the manual one-time mitigation to return traffic to a large number of routers caused a temporary period of congestion, leading to increased loss and latency between 11:13 and 11:24. Additionally, a set of faulty routers in us-east4 incorrectly had traffic routed to them as part of this mitigation work, which resulted in further impact to the network in that region between 11:08 and 11:59. Finally, Cloud Interconnect had extended impact until 12:50 due to a lack of router vendor redundancy in some interconnect locations. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Compute Engine\r\n\r\nVM to VM inter-regional traffic via public IP’s experienced intermittent packet loss with peaks of up to 42.6%. VM to VM inter-regional traffic via private IP’s experienced intermittent packet loss with peaks of up to 15.6%. Connectivity within a zone was not impacted. The period of impact was between 08:20 and 11:59.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Cloud Load Balancing\r\n\r\nRequests to Cloud load balancers and Cloud CDN experienced increased timeouts, errors of up to 25%, and additional latency between 08:20 and 10:43. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Cloud Interconnect\r\n\r\nCloud interconnect experienced intermittent packet loss for interconnects, with peaks of up to 100% loss lasting several minutes between 08:20 and 12:50. Some interconnect locations did not have sufficient vendor redundancy for routers, resulting in a longer period of impact during traffic redirection.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Cloud VPN\r\n\r\nUp to 13.5% of Cloud VPN tunnels experienced intermittent connectivity loss between 08:29 and 10:46.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Kubernetes Engine\r\n\r\nZonal clusters were impacted due to the impact to Cloud Networking and Compute Engine and experienced increased latency, errors, and packet loss for requests to the Kubernetes control plane. Regional clusters were unaffected due to master node redundancy. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### App Engine Flex\r\n\r\nSome App Engine Flex traffic experienced increased latency during the incident.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Cloud Spanner\r\n\r\nCloud Spanner experienced increased latency and increased DEADLINE_EXCEEDED errors in us-central1, us-east1, and europe-west1 from 08:50 to 11:45.\r\n\r\n\r\n# ADDITIONAL DETAILS\r\n\r\nThe end time used in the preliminary incident statement was incorrect, as some services had lingering impact after the issue was mitigated. The corrected details for impact times are contained in the above report.",

        "text": "# ISSUE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nOn Friday, 12 February 2021, Google Cloud Networking experienced elevated packet loss for newly created, updated, deleted or migrated virtual machines (VMs) and network endpoints for a duration of 4 hours, 4 minutes. Network programming for VMs and network endpoints was also affected for the duration. To our customers whose businesses were impacted during this service disruption, we sincerely apologize – this is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\r\n\r\n# ROOT CAUSE\r\n\r\nGoogle Cloud's networking control plane has global components that are responsible for fanning-out network configurations that can affect an entire Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network to downstream (regional/zonal) networking controllers. Work has been ongoing to better isolate global networking control plane components to limit scope of impact for issues that affect these global components. Cloud Networking also relies on a suite of automation tools to manage and enforce the quota of resources allocated to VPC networks. Some quotas are enforced with logic that will automatically remove resources when the quota is decreased, and reprocess previous resource operations when quota is increased.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances that led to this was a latent issue in the control plane quota enforcement logic. During routine handling of peering quota change requests, previous operations that were rejected due to a lack of available quota were being re-evaluated and re-processed by the networking control plane. While doing this re-evaluation, the networking control plane encountered the latent issue and could not process other incoming network programming operations, triggering timeouts for those requests. As VPC resources are multi-regional in nature, this also meant that newly created, updated, deleted or migrated VM resources in regions that required programming on the network control plane were not able to establish connectivity, resulting in elevated packet loss.\r\n\r\n# REMEDIATION AND PREVENTION\r\n\r\nOnce the nature and scope of the issue became clear, Google engineers paused VM migrations globally to prevent existing instances from being impacted. Networking quota changes were also paused to prevent a recurrence until a fix had been rolled out. The issue trigger was isolated to update operations, not initial load operations, so a rolling restart of the networking control plane was triggered to mitigate the issue. Teams worked through the weekend to ensure that recurrence was not possible by rolling out a fix globally.\r\n\r\nIn addition to fixing the underlying cause, we will be implementing changes to prevent and reduce the impact of this type of failure in several ways:\r\n\r\n1\\.

Region us-central1 experienced elevated control plane error rates of up to 50% between 15:00 and 16:15, dropping to values similar to other regions by 16:45. VM to VM traffic experienced up to 2.5% packet loss for intra-region traffic, and up to 3.5% loss for inter-region traffic.\r\n\r\n#### Cloud VPN\r\n\r\n1.4% of Cloud VPN tunnels in us-central1 lost connectivity from 15:12 to 17:00.\r\n\r\n#### Cloud Interconnect\r\nChanges to Cloud Interconnect resources experienced delayed propagation or failures during the incident.\r\n\r\n#### Compute Engine (GCE)\r\n\r\nNewly created, updated, deleted or migrated VMs failed to have networking set up during the incident. Existing instances that were not migrated or updated during the incident were not impacted.\r\n\r\n#### Kubernetes Engine (GKE)\r\n\r\nApproximately 1000 clusters were affected by the inability to provision new clusters or nodes. Node availability was impacted due to the impact to Cloud Networking and GCE instances for the duration of the incident.\r\n\r\n#### Cloud Dataproc\r\n\r\nCluster creation and update operations that created new nodes experienced failures during the incident due to the impact to GCE VM networking.\r\n\r\n#### Cloud Shell\r\n\r\nCloud Shell users assigned to us-central1 were unable to connect to Cloud Shell. Existing sessions were unaffected.\r\n\r\n#### Cloud SQL\r\n\r\n6.3% of instance creation operations failed globally between 14:55 and 17:52. Maintenance operations failed or timed out during the incident, but did not impact data plane availability on existing instances. Replica creation during the incident resulted in instances in a failed state, and were automatically recovered within 24 hours.\r\n\r\n#### Cloud Memorystore\r\n\r\nUp to 100% of instance creations failed between 15:15 and 18:20. Instances that were being live-migrated came up on new hosts without networking and faced connectivity issues until they recovered automatically.\r\n\r\n#### Cloud Data Fusion\r\n\r\nCloud Data Fusion instance creations failed during the incident due to failure to create GKE and Cloud SQL instances.\r\n\r\n#### Filestore\r\n\r\nA small number of Filestore instances were live-migrated during the incident. These newly migrated instances lost networking after the live migration before recovering on their own.\r\n\r\n#### Cloud Load Balancing\r\n\r\nCreate and update requests for global L7 external load balancers experienced up to 98% error rate between 15:17 and 18:15, and error rates up to 50% between 18:15 and 18:33. Create and update requests for regional L7 internal load balancers experienced up to 10% error rates, with us-central1 experiencing up to 70% error rates between 15:10 and 17:02.\r\n\r\n#### App Engine Flex\r\n\r\nUp to 80% of new deployments to App Engine Flex failed during the incident.",

      "text": "# ISSUE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nOn Friday, 12 February 2021, Google Cloud Networking experienced elevated packet loss for newly created, updated, deleted or migrated virtual machines (VMs) and network endpoints for a duration of 4 hours, 4 minutes. Network programming for VMs and network endpoints was also affected for the duration. To our customers whose businesses were impacted during this service disruption, we sincerely apologize – this is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\r\n\r\n# ROOT CAUSE\r\n\r\nGoogle Cloud's networking control plane has global components that are responsible for fanning-out network configurations that can affect an entire Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network to downstream (regional/zonal) networking controllers. Work has been ongoing to better isolate global networking control plane components to limit scope of impact for issues that affect these global components. Cloud Networking also relies on a suite of automation tools to manage and enforce the quota of resources allocated to VPC networks. Some quotas are enforced with logic that will automatically remove resources when the quota is decreased, and reprocess previous resource operations when quota is increased.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances that led to this was a latent issue in the control plane quota enforcement logic. During routine handling of peering quota change requests, previous operations that were rejected due to a lack of available quota were being re-evaluated and re-processed by the networking control plane. While doing this re-evaluation, the networking control plane encountered the latent issue and could not process other incoming network programming operations, triggering timeouts for those requests. As VPC resources are multi-regional in nature, this also meant that newly created, updated, deleted or migrated VM resources in regions that required programming on the network control plane were not able to establish connectivity, resulting in elevated packet loss.\r\n\r\n# REMEDIATION AND PREVENTION\r\n\r\nOnce the nature and scope of the issue became clear, Google engineers paused VM migrations globally to prevent existing instances from being impacted. Networking quota changes were also paused to prevent a recurrence until a fix had been rolled out. The issue trigger was isolated to update operations, not initial load operations, so a rolling restart of the networking control plane was triggered to mitigate the issue. Teams worked through the weekend to ensure that recurrence was not possible by rolling out a fix globally.\r\n\r\nIn addition to fixing the underlying cause, we will be implementing changes to prevent and reduce the impact of this type of failure in several ways:\r\n\r\n1\\. Add health checks and automated restarts when the networking control plane responsible for peering operations becomes unresponsive\r\n\r\n2\\. Continue work to regionalize network control plane components to reduce scope of impact for future issues of this type\r\n\r\n3\\. Automatically pause VM migrations when high numbers of VMs are exhibiting networking issues\r\n\r\n4\\. Improve monitoring of network control plane operations to decrease time to mitigation for issues of this type\r\n\r\n5\\. Improve networking data plane resilience when the networking control plane is unresponsive\r\n\r\n# DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF IMPACT\r\n\r\nOn Friday 12 February, 2021 from 14:51 to 18:55 US/Pacific, Cloud Networking control plane operations experienced increased error rates, and experienced elevated packet loss for both inter- and intra-region traffic.\r\n\r\n#### Cloud Networking\r\n\r\nElevated control plane operation error rates of up to 15% in most regions except for us-central1.  Region us-central1 experienced elevated control plane error rates of up to 50% between 15:00 and 16:15, dropping to values similar to other regions by 16:45. VM to VM traffic experienced up to 2.5% packet loss for intra-region traffic, and up to 3.5% loss for inter-region traffic.\r\n\r\n#### Cloud VPN\r\n\r\n1.4% of Cloud VPN tunnels in us-central1 lost connectivity from 15:12 to 17:00.\r\n\r\n#### Cloud Interconnect\r\nChanges to Cloud Interconnect resources experienced delayed propagation or failures during the incident.\r\n\r\n#### Compute Engine (GCE)\r\n\r\nNewly created, updated, deleted or migrated VMs failed to have networking set up during the incident.

        "text": "# ISSUE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nOn Monday 14 December, 2020, for a duration of 47 minutes, customer-facing Google services that required Google OAuth access were unavailable. Cloud Service accounts used by GCP workloads were not impacted and continued to function. We apologize to our customers whose services or businesses were impacted during this incident, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.\r\n\r\n# ROOT CAUSE\r\n\r\nThe Google User ID Service maintains a unique identifier for every account and handles authentication credentials for OAuth tokens and cookies.  It stores account data in a distributed database, which uses Paxos protocols to coordinate updates. For security reasons, this service will reject requests when it detects outdated data.\r\n\r\nGoogle uses an evolving suite of automation tools to manage the quota of various resources allocated for services. As part of an ongoing migration of the User ID Service to a new quota system, a change was made in October to register the User ID Service with the new quota system, but parts of the previous quota system were left in place which incorrectly reported the usage for the User ID Service as 0. An existing grace period on enforcing quota restrictions delayed the impact, which eventually expired, triggering automated quota systems to decrease the quota allowed for the User ID service and triggering this incident. Existing safety checks exist to prevent many unintended quota changes, but at the time they did not cover the scenario of zero reported load for a single service: \r\n\r\n• Quota changes to large number of users, since only a single group was the target of the change,   \r\n\r\n• Lowering quota below usage, since the reported usage was inaccurately being reported as zero,  \r\n\r\n• Excessive quota reduction to storage systems, since no alert fired during the grace period, \r\n\r\n• Low quota, since the difference between usage and quota exceeded the protection limit. \r\n\r\nAs a result, the quota for the account database was reduced, which prevented the Paxos leader from writing. Shortly after, the majority of read operations became outdated which resulted in errors on authentication lookups.\r\n\r\n\r\n# REMEDIATION AND PREVENTION\r\n\r\nThe scope of the problem was immediately clear as the new quotas took effect. This was detected by automated alerts for capacity at 2020-12-14 03:43 US/Pacific, and for errors with the User ID Service starting at 03:46, which paged Google Engineers at 03:48 within one minute of customer impact. At 04:08 the root cause and a potential fix were identified, which led to disabling the quota enforcement in one datacenter at 04:22. This quickly improved the situation, and at 04:27 the same mitigation was applied to all datacenters, which returned error rates to normal levels by 04:33. As outlined below, some user services took longer to fully recover. \r\n\r\nIn addition to fixing the underlying cause, we will be implementing changes to prevent, reduce the impact of, and better communicate about this type of failure in several ways:\r\n\r\n\r\n1\\. Review our quota management automation to prevent fast implementation of global changes\r\n\r\n2\\. Improve monitoring and alerting to catch incorrect configurations sooner\r\n\r\n3\\. Improve reliability of tools and procedures for posting external communications during outages that affect internal tools\r\n\r\n4\\. Evaluate and implement improved write failure resilience into our User ID service database\r\n\r\n5\\. Improve resilience of GCP Services to more strictly limit the impact to the data plane during User ID Service failures\r\n\r\nWe would like to apologize for the scope of impact that this incident had on our customers and their businesses. We take any incident that affects the availability and reliability of our customers extremely seriously, particularly incidents which span multiple regions. We are conducting a thorough investigation of the incident and will be making the changes which result from that investigation our top priority in Google Engineering.\r\n\r\n\r\n# DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF IMPACT\r\n\r\nOn Monday 14 December, 2020 from 03:46 to 04:33 US/Pacific, credential issuance and account metadata lookups for all Google user accounts failed. As a result, we could not verify that user requests were authenticated and served 5xx errors on virtually all authenticated traffic. The majority of authenticated services experienced similar control plane impact: elevated error rates across all Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace APIs and Consoles. Products continued to deliver service normally during the incident except where specifically called out below. Most services recovered automatically within a short period of time after the main issue ended at 04:33. Some services had unique or lingering impact, which is detailed below. \r\n\r\n#### Cloud Console\r\n\r\nAny users who hadn't already previously authenticated to Cloud Console were unable to login. Users who had already authenticated may have been able to use Cloud Console but may have seen some features degraded.\r\n\r\n#### Google BigQuery\r\n\r\nDuring the incident, streaming requests returned ~75% errors, while BigQuery jobs returned ~10% errors on average globally. \r\n\r\n#### Google Cloud Storage\r\n\r\nApproximately 15% of requests to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) were impacted during the outage, specifically those using OAuth, HMAC or email authentication. After 2020-12-14 04:31 US/Pacific, the majority of impact was resolved, however, there was lingering impact, for <1% of clients that attempted to finalize resumable uploads that started during the window. These uploads were left in a non-resumable state; the error code GCS returned was retryable, but subsequent retries were unable to make progress, leaving these objects unfinalized.\r\n\r\n#### Google Cloud Networking\r\n\r\nThe networking control plane continued to see elevated error rates on operations until it fully recovered at 2020-12-14 05:21 US/Pacific. Only operations that made modifications to the data plane VPC network were impacted. All existing configurations in the data plane remained operational. \r\n\r\n#### Google Kubernetes Engine \r\n\r\nDuring the incident, ~4% of requests to the GKE control plane API failed, and nearly all Google-managed and customer workloads could not report metrics to Cloud Monitoring. \r\n\r\nWe believe ~5% of requests to Kubernetes control planes failed but do not have accurate measures due to unreported Cloud Monitoring metrics.\r\n\r\nFor up to an hour after the outage, ~1.9% nodes reported conditions such as StartGracePeriod or NetworkUnavailable which may have had an impact on user workloads. \r\n\r\n#### Google Workspace\r\n\r\nAll Google Workspace services rely on Google's account infrastructure for login, authentication, and enforcement of access control on resources (e.g. documents, Calendar events, Gmail messages). As a consequence, all authenticated Google Workspace apps were down for the duration of the incident. After the issue was mitigated at 2020-12-14 04:32 US/Pacific, Google Workspace apps recovered, and most services were fully recovered by 05:00. Some services, including Google Calendar and Google Workspace Admin Console, served errors up to 05:21 due to a traffic spike following initial recovery. Some Gmail users experienced errors for up to an hour after recovery due to caching of errors from identity services.\r\n\r\n#### Cloud Support \r\n\r\nCloud Support's internal tools were impacted, which delayed our ability to share outage communications with customers on the Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace Status Dashboards. Customers were unable to create or view cases in the Cloud Console. We were able to update customers at 2020-12-14 05:34 US/Pacific after the impact had ended.",

The root cause was an issue in our automated quota management system which reduced capacity for Google's central identity management system, causing it to return errors globally. As a result, we couldn’t verify that user requests were authenticated and served errors to our users. \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n### Customer Impact:  \r\n  \r\n- GCP services (including Cloud Console, Cloud Storage, BigQuery, Google Kubernetes Engine) requiring authentication would have returned an error for all users.    \r\n- Google Workspace services (including Gmail, Calendar, Meet, Docs and Drive) requiring authentication would have returned an error for all users.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Details:    \r\n\r\n- Many of our internal users and tools experienced similar errors, which added delays to our outage external communication.  \r\n- We will publish an analysis of this incident once we have completed our internal investigation.

        "text": "# ISSUE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday 9 December, 2020, Google Cloud Platform experienced networking unavailability in zone europe-west2-a, resulting in some customers being unable to access their resources, for a duration of 1 hour 24 minutes. The following Google services had degraded service that extended beyond the initial 1 hour 24 minute network disruption:\r\n\r\n- 1.5% of Cloud Memorystore Redis instances were unhealthy for a total duration of 2 hours 24 minutes\r\n- 4.5% of Classic Cloud VPN tunnels in the europe-west2 region experienced unavailability after the main disruption had recovered and these tunnels remained down for a duration of 8 hours and 10 minutes\r\n- App Engine Flex experienced increased deployment error rates for a total duration of 1 hour 45 minutes\r\n\r\nWe apologize to our Cloud customers who were impacted during this disruption. We have conducted a thorough internal investigation and are taking immediate action to improve the resiliency and availability of our service.\r\n\r\n\r\n# ROOT CAUSE\r\n\r\nGoogle’s underlying networking control plane consists of multiple distributed components that make up the Software Defined Networking (SDN) stack. These components run on multiple machines so that failure of a machine or even multiple machines does not impact network capacity. To achieve this, the control plane elects a leader from a pool of machines to provide configuration to the various infrastructure components. The leader election process depends on a local instance of Google’s internal lock service to read various configurations and files for determining the leader. The control plane is responsible for Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) peering sessions between physical routers connecting a cloud zone to the Google backbone.\r\n\r\nGoogle’s internal lock service provides Access Control List (ACLs) mechanisms to control reading and writing of various files stored in the service. A change to the ACLs used by the network control plane caused the tasks responsible for leader election to no longer have access to the files required for the process. The production environment contained ACLs not present in the staging or canary environments due to those environments being rebuilt using updated processes during previous maintenance events. This meant that some of the ACLs removed in the change were in use in europe-west2-a, and the validation of the configuration change in testing and canary environments did not surface the issue.\r\n\r\nGoogle's resilience strategy relies on the principle of defense in depth. Specifically, despite the network control infrastructure being designed to be highly resilient, the network is designed to 'fail static' and run for a period of time without the control plane being present as an additional line of defense against failure. The network ran normally for a short period - several minutes - after the control plane had been unable to elect a leader task. After this period, BGP routing between europe-west2-a and the rest of the Google backbone network was withdrawn, resulting in isolation of the zone and inaccessibility of resources in the zone.\r\n\r\n\r\n# REMEDIATION AND PREVENTION\r\n\r\nGoogle engineers were automatically alerted to elevated error rates in europe-west2-a at 2020-12-09 18:29 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. The configuration change rollout was automatically halted as soon as the issue was detected, preventing it from reaching any other zones. At 19:30, mitigation was applied to rollback the configuration change in europe-west2-a. This completed at 19:55, mitigating the immediate issue. Some services such as Cloud MemoryStore and Cloud VPN took additional time to recover due to complications arising from the initial disruption. Services with extended recovery timelines are described in the “detailed description of impact” section below.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to preventing this situation from happening again and are implementing the following actions:\r\n\r\nIn addition to rolling back the configuration change responsible for this disruption, we are auditing all network ACLs to ensure they are consistent across environments. While the network continued to operate for a short time after the change was rolled out, we are improving the operating mode of the data plane when the control plane is unavailable for extended periods.

Additional observability will be added to lock service ACLs allowing for additional validation when making changes to ACLs.

If impact time differs significantly, it will be mentioned specifically.\r\n\r\n## Compute Engine\r\n~60% of VMs in europe-west2-a were unreachable from outside the zone. Projects affected by this incident would have observed 100% of VMs in the zone being unreachable. Communication within the zone had minor issues, but largely worked normally. VM creation and deletion operations were stalled during the outage. VMs on hosts that had hardware or other faults during the outage were not repaired and restarted onto healthy hosts during the outage.\r\n\r\n## Persistent Disk\r\nVMs in europe-west2-a experienced stuck I/O operations for 59% of standard persistent disks located in that zone. 27% of regional persistent disks in europe-west2 briefly experienced high I/O latency at the start and end of the incident. Persistent Disk snapshot creation and restore for 59% of disks located in europe-west2-a failed during the incident. Additionally, snapshot creation for Regional Persistent Disks with one replica located in zone europe-west2-a was unavailable.\r\n\r\n## Cloud SQL\r\n~79% of HA Cloud SQL instances experienced <5 minutes of downtime due to autofailover with an additional ~5% experiencing <25m of downtime after manual recovery. ~13% of HA Cloud SQL instances with legacy HA configuration did not failover because the replicas were out of sync, and were unreachable for the full duration of the incident. The remaining HA Cloud SQL instances did not failover due to stuck operations. Overall, 97.5% of Regional PD based HA instances and 23% of legacy MySQL HA instances had <25m downtime with the remaining instances being unconnectable during the outage. Google engineering is committed to improving the successful failover rate for Cloud SQL HA instances for zonal outages like this.\r\n\r\n## Google App Engine\r\nApp Engine Flex apps in europe-west2 experienced increased deployment error rates between 10% and 100% from 18:44 to 20:29.\r\nApp Engine Standard apps running in the europe-west2 region experienced increased deployment error rates of up to 9.6% that lasted from 18:38 to 18:47. ~34.7% of App Engine Standard apps in the region experienced increased serving error rates between 18:32 and 18:38.\r\n\r\n## Cloud Functions\r\n34.8% of Cloud Functions served from europe-west2 experienced increased serving error rates between 18:32 and 18:38.\r\n\r\n## Cloud Run\r\n54.8% of Cloud Run apps served from europe-west2 experienced increased serving error rates between 18:32 and 18:38.\r\n\r\n## Cloud MemoryStore\r\n~10% of Redis instances in europe-west2, were unreachable during the outage. Both standard tier and basic tier instances were affected. After the main outage was mitigated, most instances recovered, but ~1.5% of instances remained unhealthy for 60 minutes before recovering on their own.\r\n\r\n## Cloud Filestore\r\n~16% of Filestore instances in europe-west2 were unhealthy. Instances in the zone were unreachable from outside the zone, but access within the zone was largely unaffected.\r\n\r\n## Cloud Bigtable\r\n100% of single-homed Cloud Bigtable instances in europe-west2-a were unavailable during the outage, translating into 100% error rate for customer instances located in this zone.\r\n\r\n## Kubernetes Engine\r\n~67% of cluster control planes in europe-west2-a and 10% of regional clusters in europe-west2 were unavailable for the duration of the incident. Investigation into the regional cluster control plane unavailability is still ongoing. Node creation and deletion operations were stalled due to the impact to Compute Engine operations. \r\n\r\n## Cloud Interconnect\r\nElevated packet loss for zones in europe-west2. Starting at 18:31 packets destined for resources in europe-west2-a experienced loss for the duration of the incident. Additionally, interconnect attachments in europe-west2 experienced regional loss for 7 minutes at 18:31 and 8 minutes at 19:53.\r\n\r\n## Cloud Dataflow\r\n~10% of jobs in europe-west2 failed or got stuck in cancellation during the outage. ~40% of Dataflow Streaming Engine jobs in the region were degraded over the course of the incident.\r\n\r\n## Cloud VPN\r\nA number of Cloud VPN tunnels were reset during the disruption and were automatically relocated to other zones in the region. This is within the design of the product, as the loss of one zone is planned. However once zone europe-west2-a reconnected to the network, a combination of bugs in the VPN control plane were triggered by some of the now stale VPN gateways in the zone. This caused an outage to 4.5% of Classic Cloud VPN tunnels in europe-west2 for a duration of 8 hours and 10 minutes after the main disruption had recovered.\r\n\r\n## Cloud Dataproc\r\n~0.01% of Dataproc API requests to europe-west2 returned UNAVAILABLE during the incident. The majority of these requests were read-only requests (ListClusters, ListJobs, etc.)\r\n\r\n\r\n# SLA CREDITS\r\n\r\nIf you believe your paid application experienced an SLA violation as a result of this incident, please submit the SLA credit request: https://support.google.com/cloud/contact/cloud_platform_sla \r\n\r\nA full list of all Google Cloud Platform Service Level Agreements can be found at https://cloud.google.com/terms/sla/",

      "text": "# ISSUE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday 9 December, 2020, Google Cloud Platform experienced networking unavailability in zone europe-west2-a, resulting in some customers being unable to access their resources, for a duration of 1 hour 24 minutes. The following Google services had degraded service that extended beyond the initial 1 hour 24 minute network disruption:\r\n\r\n- 1.5% of Cloud Memorystore Redis instances were unhealthy for a total duration of 2 hours 24 minutes\r\n- 4.5% of Classic Cloud VPN tunnels in the europe-west2 region experienced unavailability after the main disruption had recovered and these tunnels remained down for a duration of 8 hours and 10 minutes\r\n- App Engine Flex experienced increased deployment error rates for a total duration of 1 hour 45 minutes\r\n\r\nWe apologize to our Cloud customers who were impacted during this disruption. We have conducted a thorough internal investigation and are taking immediate action to improve the resiliency and availability of our service.\r\n\r\n\r\n# ROOT CAUSE\r\n\r\nGoogle’s underlying networking control plane consists of multiple distributed components that make up the Software Defined Networking (SDN) stack. These components run on multiple machines so that failure of a machine or even multiple machines does not impact network capacity. To achieve this, the control plane elects a leader from a pool of machines to provide configuration to the various infrastructure components. The leader election process depends on a local instance of Google’s internal lock service to read various configurations and files for determining the leader. The control plane is responsible for Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) peering sessions between physical routers connecting a cloud zone to the Google backbone.\r\n\r\nGoogle’s internal lock service provides Access Control List (ACLs) mechanisms to control reading and writing of various files stored in the service. A change to the ACLs used by the network control plane caused the tasks responsible for leader election to no longer have access to the files required for the process. The production environment contained ACLs not present in the staging or canary environments due to those environments being rebuilt using updated processes during previous maintenance events. This meant that some of the ACLs removed in the change were in use in europe-west2-a, and the validation of the configuration change in testing and canary environments did not surface the issue.\r\n\r\nGoogle's resilience strategy relies on the principle of defense in depth. Specifically, despite the network control infrastructure being designed to be highly resilient, the network is designed to 'fail static' and run for a period of time without the control plane being present as an additional line of defense against failure. The network ran normally for a short period - several minutes - after the control plane had been unable to elect a leader task. After this period, BGP routing between europe-west2-a and the rest of the Google backbone network was withdrawn, resulting in isolation of the zone and inaccessibility of resources in the zone.\r\n\r\n\r\n# REMEDIATION AND PREVENTION\r\n\r\nGoogle engineers were automatically alerted to elevated error rates in europe-west2-a at 2020-12-09 18:29 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. The configuration change rollout was automatically halted as soon as the issue was detected, preventing it from reaching any other zones. At 19:30, mitigation was applied to rollback the configuration change in europe-west2-a. This completed at 19:55, mitigating the immediate issue. Some services such as Cloud MemoryStore and Cloud VPN took additional time to recover due to complications arising from the initial disruption. Services with extended recovery timelines are described in the “detailed description of impact” section below.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to preventing this situation from happening again and are implementing the following actions:\r\n\r\nIn addition to rolling back the configuration change responsible for this disruption, we are auditing all network ACLs to ensure they are consistent across environments. While the network continued to operate for a short time after the change was rolled out, we are improving the operating mode of the data plane when the control plane is unavailable for extended periods. Improvements in visibility to recent changes will be made to reduce the time to mitigation. Additional observability will be added to lock service ACLs allowing for additional validation when making changes to ACLs. We are also improving the canary and release process for future changes of this type to ensure these changes are made safely.\r\n\r\n\r\n# DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF IMPACT\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday 9 December, 2020 from 18:31 to 19:55 US/Pacific Google Cloud experienced unavailability for some Google services hosted in zone europe-west2-a as described in detail below.

        "text": "# BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nGoogle’s Global Service Load Balancer (GSLB) is a collection of software and services that load balance traffic across Google properties. There are two main components, a control plane, and a data plane. The control plane provides programming to the data plane on how to handle requests. A key component of the data plane is the  Google Front End (GFE). The GFE is an HTTP/TCP reverse proxy which is used to serve requests to many Google properties including: Search, Ads, G Suite (Gmail, Chat, Meet, Docs, Drive, etc.), Cloud External HTTP(S) Load Balancing, Proxy/SSL Load Balancing, and many Cloud APIs. \r\n\r\nGoogle’s Global Load Balancers are implemented using a GFE architecture that has two tiers in some cases. The first tier of GFEs are situated as close to the user as possible to minimize latency during connection setup. First tier GFEs route requests either directly to applications, or in some cases to a second tier of GFEs providing additional functionality, before routing to applications. This architecture allows clients to have low latency connections anywhere in the world, while taking advantage of Google’s global network to serve requests to backends, regardless of region.\r\n\r\nThe pool of GFE instances which were impacted in this incident are part of the second tier, handling a subset of Google services. Therefore, this incident only impacted services routed through this specific pool.\r\n\r\n# ISSUE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nOn Thursday 24 September, 2020 at 18:00 US/Pacific, one of Google’s several second-tier GFE pools experienced intermittent failures resulting in impact to several downstream services. Almost all services recovered within the initial 33 minutes of the incident; exceptions are outlined in the detailed impact section below. Affected customers experienced elevated error rates and latency when connecting to Google APIs. Existing workloads (i.e. running instances on GCE, or containers on GKE) were not impacted unless they needed to invoke impacted APIs.\r\n\r\nService impact can be divided into two categories, direct and indirect. Services which have a request path that flows through the impacted GFE pool would have been directly impacted. Calls to these services would have experienced higher latency or elevated errors in the form of HTTP 502 response codes. Alternatively, services which did not directly rely on this pool of impacted GFEs may invoke other services, such as authentication, that depend on this shared pool of GFEs. This indirect impact would have varied between customers. One example of this, which we expect to be one of the most common forms of indirect impact, would be use of an oauth token that needed to be refreshed or retrieved. While a service such as Cloud Spanner may not have been serving errors, customers using the Cloud Spanner Client may have seen errors when the client attempted to refresh credentials, depending on the API used to refresh/obtain the credential. A detailed description of impact can be found below.\r\n\r\nTo our Cloud customers whose businesses were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize – we have conducted a thorough internal investigation and are taking immediate action to improve the resiliency, performance, and availability of our services.\r\n\r\n# ROOT CAUSE\r\nFor any given pool of tasks, the GFE control plane has a global view of capacity, service configurations, and network conditions, which are all combined and sent to GFEs to create efficient request serving paths. This global view allows requests to be routed seamlessly to other regions, which is useful in scenarios like failover or for load balancing between regions. GFEs are grouped into pools for a variety of traffic profiles, health checking requirements, and other factors; the impacted second-layer GFE pool was used by multiple services. \r\n\r\nThe GFE control plane picks up service configuration changes and distributes them to GFEs. For this incident, two service changes contained an error that resulted in a significant increase in the number of backends accessed by GFEs in this pool. The particular nature of these changes additionally meant that they would be distributed to all GFEs in this pool globally, instead of being limited to a particular region. While the global aspect was intended, the magnitude of backend increases was not. The greatly increased number of programmed backends caused GFEs to exceed their memory allocation in many locations. \r\n\r\nGFE has many internal protections which are activated when there is memory pressure, such as closing idle connections or refusing to accept new connections, allowing them to keep running despite a memory shortage. Tasks which exceeded memory limits were terminated. The combination of a reduced number of available GFEs and a reduction in accepted connections meant that traffic to services behind the impacted GFE pool dropped by 50%.\r\n\r\n# REMEDIATION AND PREVENTION\r\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage three minutes after impact began at 2020-09-24 18:03, and immediately began an investigation. At 18:15 the first service change, which significantly increased the number of programmed backends, was rolled back.  At 18:18 the second service configuration change was rolled back.  Google engineers started seeing recovery at 18:20 and at 18:33 the issue was fully mitigated.\r\n\r\nGFE is one of the most critical pieces of infrastructure at Google and has multiple lines of defense in depth, both in software and operating procedure. As the result of this outage, we are adding additional protections to both in order to eliminate this class of failure. As an immediate step we have limited the type of configuration changes that can be made until additional safeguards are in place. Those additional safeguards will include stricter validation of configuration changes; specifically, rejecting changes that cause a large increase in backend count across multiple services. In addition to a check in the control plane, we will be augmenting existing protections in the GFE against unbounded growth in any resource dimension, such as backend counts. We will also be performing an audit of existing configurations and converting risky configurations to alternative setups. A restriction will be placed on certain configuration options, only allowing use with additional review and allow lists. Finally, an audit will be performed of services in shared GFE pools, with additional pools being created to reduce impact radius, should an issue in this part of the infrastructure surface again.\r\n\r\n\r\n# DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF IMPACT\r\nOn 2020-09-24 from 18:00 to 18:33 US/Pacific (unless otherwise noted) the following services were impacted globally:\r\n\r\n### OAuth\r\nThe following OAuth paths were impacted and returned errors for 50% of requests during the impact period. Impact perceived by customers may have been less as many client libraries make requests to these paths asynchronous to refresh tokens before they expire and retry their requests upon failure, potentially receiving successful responses:\r\n\r\n    - oauth2.googleapis.com/token\r\n    - accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token \r\n    - www.youtube.com/o/oauth2/token\r\n    - www.googleapis.com/o/oauth2/token \r\n    - www.googleapis.com/oauth2/{v3,v4}/token\r\n    - accounts.{google,youtube}.com/o/oauth2/{revoke,device/code,tokeninfo}\r\n    - www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/authadvice\r\n    - www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v2/IssueToken\r\n    - oauthaccountmanager.googleapis.com\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following APIs were NOT affected: \r\n\r\n    - www.googleapis.com/oauth2/{v1,v2,v3}/certs\r\n    - contents.googleapis.com/oauth2/{v1,v2,v3}/certs\r\n    - contents6.googleapis.com/oauth2/{v1,v2,v3}/certs\r\n    - iamcredentials.googleapis.com and accounts.google.com (other than specific URLs mentioned above) were not affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Chat\r\nGoogle Chat experienced an elevated rate of HTTP 500 & 502 errors (averaging 34%) between 18:00 and 18:04, decreasing to a 7% error rate from 18:04 to 18:14, with a mean latency of 500ms. This resulted in affected users being unable to load the Chat page or to send Chat messages.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Classic Hangouts\r\nClassic Hangouts experienced an elevated error rate of HTTP 500 errors (reducing Hangouts traffic by 44%) between 18:00 and 18:25. The service error rate was below 1% for Hangouts requests within the product, including sending messages.\r\n\r\n### Meet\r\nGoogle Meet experienced error rates up to 23% of requests between 18:02 and 18:23. Affected users observed call startup failures which affected 85% of session attempts. Existing Meet sessions were not affected.\r\n\r\n### Voice\r\nGoogle Voice experienced a 66% drop in traffic between 18:00 and 18:24. Additionally, the service had an elevated error rate below 1% between 18:01 and 18:14, and an average of 100% increase in mean latency between 18:03 and 18:12.\r\n\r\n### Calendar\r\nGoogle Calendar web traffic observed up to a 60% reduction in traffic, and an elevated HTTP 500 error rate of 4.8% between 18:01 and 18:06, which decreased to and remained below 1% for the remainder of the outage. Calendar API traffic observed up to a 53% reduction in traffic, with an average error rate of 2% for the same period. The traffic reduction corresponded with HTTP 500 errors being served to users.\r\n\r\n### Groups\r\nGoogle Groups web traffic dropped roughly 50% for the classic UI, and 30% for the new UI. Users experienced an average elevated HTTP 500 error rate between 0.12 and 3%.\r\n\r\n### Gmail\r\nGmail observed a 35% drop in traffic due to the GFE responding with HTTP 500 errors. The service error rate remained below 1% for the duration of the incident. This affected Gmail page loading and web interactions with the product.\r\n\r\n### Docs\r\nGoogle Docs witnessed a 33% drop in traffic between 18:00 and 18:23, corresponding with the GFE returning HTTP 500 errors to user interactions. Additionally, between 18:01 and 18:06 the service error rate rose to 1.4%, before decreasing and remaining at approximately 0.3% until 18:23.\r\n\r\n### Drive\r\nGoogle Drive observed a 60% traffic drop between 18:00 and 18:23, corresponding with the GFE returning HTTP 500 errors to user interactions. The Drive API experienced a peak error rate of 7% between 18:02 to 18:04, and then between 1% and 2% until 18:25. Google Drive web saw up to a 4% error rate between 18:01 and 18:06. 50th percentile latency was unaffected, but 95th percentile rose up to 1.3s between 18:02 and 18:06.\r\n\r\n### Cloud Bigtable\r\nSome clients using the impacted OAuth authentication methods described above were unable to refresh their credentials and thus unable to access Cloud Bigtable. Clients using alternative authentication methods were not impacted. Impacted clients experienced elevated error rates and latency. The main impact was to clients accessing Cloud Bigtable from outside of GCP, there was a 38% drop in this traffic during the impact period.\r\n\r\n### Cloud Build API\r\nCloud Build API experienced elevated error rates due to a 50% loss of incoming traffic over 26 minutes before reaching the service front end. Additionally, 4% of Cloud Builds failed due receiving errors from other Google services\r\n\r\n### Cloud Key Management Service (KMS)\r\nCloud KMS was unable to receive API requests from GFE for ~33 minutes starting at 18:00 impacting non-Customer Managed Encryption Key (CMEK) customers.  CMEK customers were not impacted. \r\n\r\n### Cloud Logging\r\nCloud Logging experienced increased error rates (25% average, up to 40% at peak) from 18:05 to 18:50.  Customers would have experienced errors when viewing logs in the Cloud Console. Data ingestion was not impacted.\r\n\r\n### Cloud Monitoring\r\nCloud Monitoring API experienced elevated error rates (50% average, up to 80% at peak) of uptime checks and requests from 18:00 - 18:26.  This affected cloud uptime workers running uptime checks.  \r\n\r\n### Cloud Networking API\r\nCloud Networking API experienced up to 50% error rate for Network Load Balancer Creation from 18:00 to 18:20 due to downstream service errors. Additionally up to 35% of HTTP(S) Load Balancer or TCP/SSL Proxy Load Balancer creation requests failed from 18:00 - 18:28 due to downstream service errors. Traffic for existing load balancers was unaffected. \r\n\r\n### Google Compute Engine API\r\nThe Google Compute Engine (GCE) API experienced an error rate of up to 50% from 18:00 - 18:25 with affected users experiencing HTTP 502 error response codes. This would have prevented loading the GCE portion of the Cloud Console as well listing, modifying, and creating GCE resources via other API clients. This applies only to the GCE API. GCE instance connectivity and availability was not impacted. Please note that some GCP services were served by the impacted GFE pool, so customer workloads running inside compute instances may have seen impact if they depend on other GCP services that experienced impact. Autoscaler continued to function nominally during the outage window.\r\n\r\n### Cloud Profiler\r\nCloud Profiler API experienced an elevated rate of HTTP 502 errors due to an up to 50% reduction in global traffic for all requests.\r\n\r\n### Cloud Run API\r\nCloud Run API experienced an elevated rate of HTTP 502 errors up to 70% from 18:00 to 18:30. Existing Cloud Run deployments were unaffected.\r\n\r\n### Cloud Spanner\r\nCloud Spanner clients experienced elevated error rates due to authentication issues which caused a 20% drop in traffic. Impacted customers saw increased latency and errors accessing Cloud Spanner. Clients using alternative authentication methods, such as GKE Workload Identity, were not impacted.\r\n  \r\n### Game Servers\r\nGame Servers experienced elevated request latencies of up to 4x normal levels during the incident window, resulting in some clients experiencing connection timeouts and increased retry attempts. The service did not experience elevated error rates.\r\n\r\n### Google Cloud Console\r\n4.18% of customers experienced \"The attempted action failed\" error messages when attempting to load pages in the Cloud Console during the incident window. This prevented some customers from viewing the UI of networking, compute, billing, monitoring, and other products and services within the Cloud Console platform. \r\n\r\n### Google Cloud SQL\r\n0.08% of Cloud SQL's fleet experienced instance metrics and logging delays from 18:07 - 18:37 for a duration of 30 minutes. The Cloud SQL API did not serve errors during the outage, but incoming traffic dropped by ~30%. No spurious auto-failovers or auto-repairs were executed as a result of the incident. There were no actual instance failures. \r\n\r\n### Google Kubernetes Engine\r\nRequests to the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) control plane experienced increased timeouts and HTTP 502 error.  Up to 6.6% of cluster masters reported errors during the time of the incident. Up to 5.5% of newly added nodes to clusters may have experienced errors due to issues communicating with impacted cluster masters. \r\n\r\n### Firebase Crashlytics\r\n66% of Crashlytics imports from AWS were impacted from 18:01 - 19:01 US/Pacific for a duration of 60 minutes. This created an import backlog which was quickly worked through 10 minutes after the incident ended.\r\n\r\n### Dialogflow and Speech-to-text API\r\nRequests to Dialogflow returned up to 72% errors in the form of HTTP 502 response codes. Requests to Google Speech API may have seen up to 68% errors in the form of HTTP 502 response codes.\r\n\r\n### Cloud Firestore and Datastore\r\nCloud Firestore saw 80% of listen streams become disconnected and up to 50% error rates for query/get requests across all regions except nam5 and eur3.\r\n\r\n# SLA CREDITS\r\nIf you believe your paid application experienced an SLA violation as a result of this incident, please populate the SLA credit request: https://support.google.com/cloud/contact/cloud_platform_sla\r\n\r\nA full list of all Google Cloud Platform Service Level Agreements can be found at https://cloud.google.com/terms/sla/.\r\n\r\nFor G Suite, please request an SLA credit through one of the Support channels: https://support.google.com/a/answer/104721\r\n\r\nG Suite Service Level Agreement can be found at https://gsuite.google.com/intl/en/terms/sla.html",

      "text": "# BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nGoogle’s Global Service Load Balancer (GSLB) is a collection of software and services that load balance traffic across Google properties. There are two main components, a control plane, and a data plane. The control plane provides programming to the data plane on how to handle requests. A key component of the data plane is the  Google Front End (GFE). The GFE is an HTTP/TCP reverse proxy which is used to serve requests to many Google properties including: Search, Ads, G Suite (Gmail, Chat, Meet, Docs, Drive, etc.), Cloud External HTTP(S) Load Balancing, Proxy/SSL Load Balancing, and many Cloud APIs. \r\n\r\nGoogle’s Global Load Balancers are implemented using a GFE architecture that has two tiers in some cases. The first tier of GFEs are situated as close to the user as possible to minimize latency during connection setup. First tier GFEs route requests either directly to applications, or in some cases to a second tier of GFEs providing additional functionality, before routing to applications. This architecture allows clients to have low latency connections anywhere in the world, while taking advantage of Google’s global network to serve requests to backends, regardless of region.\r\n\r\nThe pool of GFE instances which were impacted in this incident are part of the second tier, handling a subset of Google services. Therefore, this incident only impacted services routed through this specific pool.\r\n\r\n# ISSUE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nOn Thursday 24 September, 2020 at 18:00 US/Pacific, one of Google’s several second-tier GFE pools experienced intermittent failures resulting in impact to several downstream services. Almost all services recovered within the initial 33 minutes of the incident; exceptions are outlined in the detailed impact section below. Affected customers experienced elevated error rates and latency when connecting to Google APIs. Existing workloads (i.e. running instances on GCE, or containers on GKE) were not impacted unless they needed to invoke impacted APIs.\r\n\r\nService impact can be divided into two categories, direct and indirect. Services which have a request path that flows through the impacted GFE pool would have been directly impacted. Calls to these services would have experienced higher latency or elevated errors in the form of HTTP 502 response codes. Alternatively, services which did not directly rely on this pool of impacted GFEs may invoke other services, such as authentication, that depend on this shared pool of GFEs. This indirect impact would have varied between customers. One example of this, which we expect to be one of the most common forms of indirect impact, would be use of an oauth token that needed to be refreshed or retrieved. While a service such as Cloud Spanner may not have been serving errors, customers using the Cloud Spanner Client may have seen errors when the client attempted to refresh credentials, depending on the API used to refresh/obtain the credential. A detailed description of impact can be found below.\r\n\r\nTo our Cloud customers whose businesses were impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize – we have conducted a thorough internal investigation and are taking immediate action to improve the resiliency, performance, and availability of our services.\r\n\r\n# ROOT CAUSE\r\nFor any given pool of tasks, the GFE control plane has a global view of capacity, service configurations, and network conditions, which are all combined and sent to GFEs to create efficient request serving paths. This global view allows requests to be routed seamlessly to other regions, which is useful in scenarios like failover or for load balancing between regions. GFEs are grouped into pools for a variety of traffic profiles, health checking requirements, and other factors; the impacted second-layer GFE pool was used by multiple services. \r\n\r\nThe GFE control plane picks up service configuration changes and distributes them to GFEs. For this incident, two service changes contained an error that resulted in a significant increase in the number of backends accessed by GFEs in this pool. The particular nature of these changes additionally meant that they would be distributed to all GFEs in this pool globally, instead of being limited to a particular region. While the global aspect was intended, the magnitude of backend increases was not. The greatly increased number of programmed backends caused GFEs to exceed their memory allocation in many locations. \r\n\r\nGFE has many internal protections which are activated when there is memory pressure, such as closing idle connections or refusing to accept new connections, allowing them to keep running despite a memory shortage. Tasks which exceeded memory limits were terminated. The combination of a reduced number of available GFEs and a reduction in accepted connections meant that traffic to services behind the impacted GFE pool dropped by 50%.\r\n\r\n# REMEDIATION AND PREVENTION\r\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the outage three minutes after impact began at 2020-09-24 18:03, and immediately began an investigation. At 18:15 the first service change, which significantly increased the number of programmed backends, was rolled back.  At 18:18 the second service configuration change was rolled back.  Google engineers started seeing recovery at 18:20 and at 18:33 the issue was fully mitigated.\r\n\r\nGFE is one of the most critical pieces of infrastructure at Google and has multiple lines of defense in depth, both in software and operating procedure. As the result of this outage, we are adding additional protections to both in order to eliminate this class of failure. As an immediate step we have limited the type of configuration changes that can be made until additional safeguards are in place. Those additional safeguards will include stricter validation of configuration changes; specifically, rejecting changes that cause a large increase in backend count across multiple services. In addition to a check in the control plane, we will be augmenting existing protections in the GFE against unbounded growth in any resource dimension, such as backend counts. We will also be performing an audit of existing configurations and converting risky configurations to alternative setups. A restriction will be placed on certain configuration options, only allowing use with additional review and allow lists. Finally, an audit will be performed of services in shared GFE pools, with additional pools being created to reduce impact radius, should an issue in this part of the infrastructure surface again.\r\n\r\n\r\n# DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF IMPACT\r\nOn 2020-09-24 from 18:00 to 18:33 US/Pacific (unless otherwise noted) the following services were impacted globally:\r\n\r\n### OAuth\r\nThe following OAuth paths were impacted and returned errors for 50% of requests during the impact period.

Google Drive web saw up to a 4% error rate between 18:01 and 18:06. 50th percentile latency was unaffected, but 95th percentile rose up to 1.3s between 18:02 and 18:06.\r\n\r\n### Cloud Bigtable\r\nSome clients using the impacted OAuth authentication methods described above were unable to refresh their credentials and thus unable to access Cloud Bigtable. Clients using alternative authentication methods were not impacted. Impacted clients experienced elevated error rates and latency. The main impact was to clients accessing Cloud Bigtable from outside of GCP, there was a 38% drop in this traffic during the impact period.\r\n\r\n### Cloud Build API\r\nCloud Build API experienced elevated error rates due to a 50% loss of incoming traffic over 26 minutes before reaching the service front end. Additionally, 4% of Cloud Builds failed due receiving errors from other Google services\r\n\r\n### Cloud Key Management Service (KMS)\r\nCloud KMS was unable to receive API requests from GFE for ~33 minutes starting at 18:00 impacting non-Customer Managed Encryption Key (CMEK) customers.  CMEK customers were not impacted. \r\n\r\n### Cloud Logging\r\nCloud Logging experienced increased error rates (25% average, up to 40% at peak) from 18:05 to 18:50.  Customers would have experienced errors when viewing logs in the Cloud Console. Data ingestion was not impacted.\r\n\r\n### Cloud Monitoring\r\nCloud Monitoring API experienced elevated error rates (50% average, up to 80% at peak) of uptime checks and requests from 18:00 - 18:26.  This affected cloud uptime workers running uptime checks.  \r\n\r\n### Cloud Networking API\r\nCloud Networking API experienced up to 50% error rate for Network Load Balancer Creation from 18:00 to 18:20 due to downstream service errors. Additionally up to 35% of HTTP(S) Load Balancer or TCP/SSL Proxy Load Balancer creation requests failed from 18:00 - 18:28 due to downstream service errors. Traffic for existing load balancers was unaffected. \r\n\r\n### Google Compute Engine API\r\nThe Google Compute Engine (GCE) API experienced an error rate of up to 50% from 18:00 - 18:25 with affected users experiencing HTTP 502 error response codes. This would have prevented loading the GCE portion of the Cloud Console as well listing, modifying, and creating GCE resources via other API clients. This applies only to the GCE API. GCE instance connectivity and availability was not impacted. Please note that some GCP services were served by the impacted GFE pool, so customer workloads running inside compute instances may have seen impact if they depend on other GCP services that experienced impact. Autoscaler continued to function nominally during the outage window.\r\n\r\n### Cloud Profiler\r\nCloud Profiler API experienced an elevated rate of HTTP 502 errors due to an up to 50% reduction in global traffic for all requests.\r\n\r\n### Cloud Run API\r\nCloud Run API experienced an elevated rate of HTTP 502 errors up to 70% from 18:00 to 18:30. Existing Cloud Run deployments were unaffected.\r\n\r\n### Cloud Spanner\r\nCloud Spanner clients experienced elevated error rates due to authentication issues which caused a 20% drop in traffic. Impacted customers saw increased latency and errors accessing Cloud Spanner. Clients using alternative authentication methods, such as GKE Workload Identity, were not impacted.\r\n  \r\n### Game Servers\r\nGame Servers experienced elevated request latencies of up to 4x normal levels during the incident window, resulting in some clients experiencing connection timeouts and increased retry attempts. The service did not experience elevated error rates.\r\n\r\n### Google Cloud Console\r\n4.18% of customers experienced \"The attempted action failed\" error messages when attempting to load pages in the Cloud Console during the incident window. This prevented some customers from viewing the UI of networking, compute, billing, monitoring, and other products and services within the Cloud Console platform. \r\n\r\n### Google Cloud SQL\r\n0.08% of Cloud SQL's fleet experienced instance metrics and logging delays from 18:07 - 18:37 for a duration of 30 minutes. The Cloud SQL API did not serve errors during the outage, but incoming traffic dropped by ~30%. No spurious auto-failovers or auto-repairs were executed as a result of the incident. There were no actual instance failures. \r\n\r\n### Google Kubernetes Engine\r\nRequests to the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) control plane experienced increased timeouts and HTTP 502 error.  Up to 6.6% of cluster masters reported errors during the time of the incident. Up to 5.5% of newly added nodes to clusters may have experienced errors due to issues communicating with impacted cluster masters. \r\n\r\n### Firebase Crashlytics\r\n66% of Crashlytics imports from AWS were impacted from 18:01 - 19:01 US/Pacific for a duration of 60 minutes. This created an import backlog which was quickly worked through 10 minutes after the incident ended.\r\n\r\n### Dialogflow and Speech-to-text API\r\nRequests to Dialogflow returned up to 72% errors in the form of HTTP 502 response codes. Requests to Google Speech API may have seen up to 68% errors in the form of HTTP 502 response codes.\r\n\r\n### Cloud Firestore and Datastore\r\nCloud Firestore saw 80% of listen streams become disconnected and up to 50% error rates for query/get requests across all regions except nam5 and eur3.\r\n\r\n# SLA CREDITS\r\nIf you believe your paid application experienced an SLA violation as a result of this incident, please populate the SLA credit request: https://support.google.com/cloud/contact/cloud_platform_sla\r\n\r\nA full list of all Google Cloud Platform Service Level Agreements can be found at https://cloud.google.com/terms/sla/.\r\n\r\nFor G Suite, please request an SLA credit through one of the Support channels: https://support.google.com/a/answer/104721\r\n\r\nG Suite Service Level Agreement can be found at https://gsuite.google.com/intl/en/terms/sla.html",

        "text": "# ISSUE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nOn 2020-06-29 07:47 US/Pacific, Google Cloud experienced unavailability for some services hosted from our us-east1-c and us-east1-d zones. The unavailability primarily impacted us-east1-c but did have a short impact on us-east1-d. For approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes, 22.5% of Google Compute Engine (GCE) instances in us-east1-c, were unavailable. For approximately 7 minutes, 1.8% of GCE instances in us-east1-d, were unavailable. In addition, 0.0267% Persistent Disk (PD) devices hosted in us-east1-c were unavailable for up to 28 hours and the us-east1 region as a whole experienced 5% packet loss between 07:55 and 08:05 for Public IP and Network LB Traffic.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize and are taking steps detailed below to ensure this doesn’t happen again.\r\n\r\n# BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nGoogle Cloud Platform is built on various layers of abstraction in order to provide scale and distinct failure domains. One of those abstractions is Zones and clusters [1]. Zonal services such as Google Compute Engine (GCE) assign projects to one cluster to handle the majority of the compute needs when a project requests resources in a cloud zone. If a cluster backing a zone becomes degraded, services in that zone have resilience built in to handle some level of machine failures. Regional services, depending on the architecture, may see a short degradation before automatically recovering, or see no impact at all. Regional services with tasks in a degraded cluster are generally migrated to other functional clusters in the same region to reduce overall impact. In the Detailed Impact section below, the impact is only to projects and services mapped to the affected clusters, unless otherwise noted. \r\n\r\nDatacenter power delivery is architected in three tiers. The primary tier of power delivery is utility power, with multiple grid feeds and robust substations. Backing up utility power are generators, each generator powers a different part of each cluster, and additional backup generators and fuel are available if required in the event that a part of this backup power system fails.The fuel supply system for the generators is broken into two parts, storage tanks which store fuel in bulk, and a system which pumps that fuel to generators for consumption.  The final tier of power delivery are batteries which provide power conditioning and a short run times when power from the other two tiers is interrupted.\r\n\r\n[1] https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones#zones_and_clusters\r\n\r\n# ROOT CAUSE\r\n\r\nDuring planned substation maintenance by the site’s electrical utility provider, two clusters supporting the us-east1 region were transferred to backup generator power for the duration of the maintenance, which was scheduled as a four hour window. Three hours into the maintenance window, 17% of the operating generators began to run out of fuel due to fuel delivery system failures even though there was adequate fuel available in the storage tanks. Multiple redundancies built into the backup power system were automatically activated as primary generators began to run out of fuel, however, as more primary generators ran out of fuel the part of the cluster they were supporting shutdown.\r\n \r\n\r\n# REMEDIATION AND PREVENTION\r\n\r\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the power issue impacting us-east1-c and us-east1-d at 2020-06-29 07:50 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Impact to us-east1-d was resolved automatically by cluster level services. Other than some Persistent Disk devices, service impact in us-east1-d ended by 08:24. Onsite datacenter operators identified a fuel supply issue as the root cause of the power loss and quickly established a mitigation plan. Once a workaround for the fuel supply issue was deployed, the operators began restoring the affected generators to active service at 08:49. Almost at the same time, at 08:55, the planned substation maintenance had concluded and utility power returned to service.  Between the restored utility power and recovered generators, power was fully restored to both clusters by 08:59.\r\n\r\nIn a datacenter recovery scenario there is a sequential process that must be followed for downstream service recovery to succeed. By 2020-06-29 09:34, most GCE instances had recovered as the necessary upstream services were restored.  All services had recovered by 10:50 except for a small percentage of Persistent Disk impacted instances.  A more detailed timeline of individual service impact is included below in the “DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF IMPACT” section below.\r\n\r\nIn the days following this incident the same system was put under load. There was an unplanned utility power outage for the same location on 2020-06-30 (the next day) due to a lightning strike near a substation transformer. The system was again tested on 2020-07-02 when a final maintenance operation was conducted on the site substation.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to preventing this situation from happening again and are implementing the following actions:  \r\n\r\nResolving the issues identified with the fuel supply system which led to this incident. \r\nAn audit of sites which have a similar fuel system has been conducted and onsite personnel have been provided updated procedures and training for dealing with this situation should it occur again. \r\n\r\n\r\n# DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF IMPACT\r\nOn 2020-06-29 from 07:47 to 10:50 US/Pacific, Google Cloud experienced unavailability for some services hosted from cloud zones us-east1-c and us-east1-d as described in detail below:\r\n\r\n## Google Compute Engine \r\n\r\n22.5% of Google Compute Engine (GCE) instances in the us-east1-c zone were unavailable starting 2020-06-29 07:57 US/Pacific for 1 hour and 30 minutes. Up to  1.8% of instances in the us-east1-d zone were unavailable starting 2020-06-29 08:17 for 7 minutes.  A small percentage of the instances in us-east1-c continued to be unavailable for up to 28 hours due to manual recovery of PD devices. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Persistent Disk\r\n\r\nPersistent Disk (PD) experienced 23% of PD devices becoming degraded in us-east1-c starting at 2020-06-29 07:53 to 2020-06-29 09:28 US/Pacific for a duration of 1 hour and 35 minutes.  0.0267% of PD devices were unable to recover automatically and required manual recovery which completed at 2020-06-30 09:54 resulting in 26 hours of additional unavailability. \r\n\r\nThe delay in recovery was primarily due to a configuration setting in PD clients that set metadata initialization retry attempts to a maximum value (with exponential backoff). Upon power loss, 0.0267% of PD devices in us-east1-c  reached this limit and were unable to recover automatically as they had exhausted their retry attempts before power had been fully restored. To prevent this scenario from recurring, we are significantly increasing the number of retry attempts that will be performed by PD metadata initialization to ensure PD can recover from extended periods of power loss.\r\n\r\nA secondary factor resulting in the delay of some customer VMs was due to filesystem errors triggered by the PD unavailability. PD itself maintains defense-in-depth through a variety of end-to-end integrity mechanisms which prevented any PD corruption during this incident. However, some filesystems are not designed to be robust against cases where some parts of the block device presented by PD fail to initialize while others are still usable. This issue was technically external to PD, and only repairable by customers using filesystem repair utilities. The PD product team assisted affected customers in their manual recovery efforts during the extended incident window.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, up to 0.429% of PD devices in us-east1-d were unhealthy for approximately 1 hour from 2020-06-29 08:15 to 2020-06-29 09:10.  All PD devices in us-east1-d recovered automatically once power had been restored.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Cloud Networking \r\n\r\nThe us-east1 region as a whole experienced a 5% packet loss between 07:55 and 08:05 for Public IP and Network LB Traffic as Maglevs [1] servicing the region in the impacted cluster became unavailable.\r\n\r\nCloud VPN saw 7% of Classic VPN tunnels in us-east1 reset between 07:57 and 08:07. As tunnels disconnected, they were rescheduled automatically in other clusters in the region. HA VPN tunnels were not impacted.\r\n\r\nCloud Router saw 13% of BGP sessions in us-east1 flap between 07:57 and 08:07, Cloud Router tasks in the impacted cluster were rescheduled automatically in other clusters in the region.\r\n\r\nCloud HTTP(S) Load Balancing saw a 166% spike in baseline HTTP 500 errors between 08:00 to 08:10.\r\n\r\nStarting at 09:38 the network control plane in the impacted cluster began to initialize but ran into an issue that required manual intervention to resolve. Between 09:38 and 10:14 instances continued to be inaccessible until the control plane initialized, updates were also not being propagated down to the cluster control plane. Due to this, some resources such as Internal Load Balancers and instances that were deleted during this time period, and then recreated at any time between 9:38 and 12:47 would have seen availability issues. This was resolved with additional intervention from the SRE team. \r\n\r\nTo reduce time to recover for similar classes of issues, we are increasing the robustness of the control plane to better handle such exceptional failure conditions. We are also implementing additional monitoring and alerting to more quickly detect update propagation issues under exceptional failure conditions\r\n\r\n[1] https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/google-shares-software-network-load-balancer-design-powering-gcp-networking \r\n\r\n## Cloud SQL\r\n\r\nGoogle Cloud SQL experienced a 7% drop in network connections that resulted in database unavailability from 2020-06-29 08:00 - 10:50 US/Pacific affecting <1.5% of instances in us-east1 due to power loss. This degraded Cloud SQL dependencies (Persistent Disk and GCE) in us-east1-c and us-east1-d for a period of 2 hours and 50 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Filestore + Memorystore\r\n\r\nCloud Filestore and Memorystore instances in us-east1-c were unavailable due to power loss from 2020-06-29 07:56 - 10:24 US/Pacific for a duration of 2 hours and 28 minutes. 7.4% of Redis non-HA (zonal) instances in us-east1 were unavailable and 5.9% of Redis HA (regional) standard tier instances in us-east1 failed over. All Cloud Filestore and Cloud Memorystore instances recovered by 10:24.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Google Kubernetes Engine\r\n\r\nGoogle Kubernetes Engine (GKE) customers were unable to create or delete clusters in either the us-east1-c zone or the us-east1 region from 2020-06-29 8:00 to 2020-06-29 10:30 US/Pacific. Additionally, customers could not create nodepools in the us-east1-c zone during that same period. A maximum of 29% of zonal clusters in us-east1-c and 2% of zonal clusters in us-east1-d could not be administered; all but a small subset of clusters recovered by 11:00, and the remaining clusters recovered by 14:30.  Existing regional clusters in us-east1 were not affected except for customers who had workloads on nodes in us-east1-c that they could not or were unable to migrate.\r\n\r\n## Google Cloud Storage\r\n\r\nGoogle Cloud Storage (GCS) in us-east1 experienced 10 minutes of impact when availability fell down to 99.7%, with a 3-minute burst down to 98.6% availability.  GCS multi-region experienced a total of 40 minutes of impact, down to 99.55% availability. \r\n\r\n# SLA CREDITS\r\nIf you believe your paid application experienced an SLA violation as a result of this incident, please submit the SLA credit request: https://support.google.com/cloud/contact/cloud_platform_sla\r\n\r\nA full list of all Google Cloud Platform Service Level Agreements can be found at https://cloud.google.com/terms/sla/",

Backing up utility power are generators, each generator powers a different part of each cluster, and additional backup generators and fuel are available if required in the event that a part of this backup power system fails.The fuel supply system for the generators is broken into two parts, storage tanks which store fuel in bulk, and a system which pumps that fuel to generators for consumption.  The final tier of power delivery are batteries which provide power conditioning and a short run times when power from the other two tiers is interrupted.\r\n\r\n[1] https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones#zones_and_clusters\r\n\r\n# ROOT CAUSE\r\n\r\nDuring planned substation maintenance by the site’s electrical utility provider, two clusters supporting the us-east1 region were transferred to backup generator power for the duration of the maintenance, which was scheduled as a four hour window. Three hours into the maintenance window, 17% of the operating generators began to run out of fuel due to fuel delivery system failures even though there was adequate fuel available in the storage tanks. Multiple redundancies built into the backup power system were automatically activated as primary generators began to run out of fuel, however, as more primary generators ran out of fuel the part of the cluster they were supporting shutdown.\r\n \r\n\r\n# REMEDIATION AND PREVENTION\r\n\r\nGoogle engineers were alerted to the power issue impacting us-east1-c and us-east1-d at 2020-06-29 07:50 US/Pacific and immediately started an investigation. Impact to us-east1-d was resolved automatically by cluster level services. Other than some Persistent Disk devices, service impact in us-east1-d ended by 08:24. Onsite datacenter operators identified a fuel supply issue as the root cause of the power loss and quickly established a mitigation plan. Once a workaround for the fuel supply issue was deployed, the operators began restoring the affected generators to active service at 08:49. Almost at the same time, at 08:55, the planned substation maintenance had concluded and utility power returned to service.  Between the restored utility power and recovered generators, power was fully restored to both clusters by 08:59.\r\n\r\nIn a datacenter recovery scenario there is a sequential process that must be followed for downstream service recovery to succeed. By 2020-06-29 09:34, most GCE instances had recovered as the necessary upstream services were restored.  All services had recovered by 10:50 except for a small percentage of Persistent Disk impacted instances.  A more detailed timeline of individual service impact is included below in the “DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF IMPACT” section below.\r\n\r\nIn the days following this incident the same system was put under load. There was an unplanned utility power outage for the same location on 2020-06-30 (the next day) due to a lightning strike near a substation transformer. The system was again tested on 2020-07-02 when a final maintenance operation was conducted on the site substation.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to preventing this situation from happening again and are implementing the following actions:  \r\n\r\nResolving the issues identified with the fuel supply system which led to this incident. \r\nAn audit of sites which have a similar fuel system has been conducted and onsite personnel have been provided updated procedures and training for dealing with this situation should it occur again. \r\n\r\n\r\n# DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF IMPACT\r\nOn 2020-06-29 from 07:47 to 10:50 US/Pacific, Google Cloud experienced unavailability for some services hosted from cloud zones us-east1-c and us-east1-d as described in detail below:\r\n\r\n## Google Compute Engine \r\n\r\n22.5% of Google Compute Engine (GCE) instances in the us-east1-c zone were unavailable starting 2020-06-29 07:57 US/Pacific for 1 hour and 30 minutes. Up to  1.8% of instances in the us-east1-d zone were unavailable starting 2020-06-29 08:17 for 7 minutes.  A small percentage of the instances in us-east1-c continued to be unavailable for up to 28 hours due to manual recovery of PD devices. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Persistent Disk\r\n\r\nPersistent Disk (PD) experienced 23% of PD devices becoming degraded in us-east1-c starting at 2020-06-29 07:53 to 2020-06-29 09:28 US/Pacific for a duration of 1 hour and 35 minutes.  0.0267% of PD devices were unable to recover automatically and required manual recovery which completed at 2020-06-30 09:54 resulting in 26 hours of additional unavailability. \r\n\r\nThe delay in recovery was primarily due to a configuration setting in PD clients that set metadata initialization retry attempts to a maximum value (with exponential backoff). Upon power loss, 0.0267% of PD devices in us-east1-c  reached this limit and were unable to recover automatically as they had exhausted their retry attempts before power had been fully restored. To prevent this scenario from recurring, we are significantly increasing the number of retry attempts that will be performed by PD metadata initialization to ensure PD can recover from extended periods of power loss.\r\n\r\nA secondary factor resulting in the delay of some customer VMs was due to filesystem errors triggered by the PD unavailability. PD itself maintains defense-in-depth through a variety of end-to-end integrity mechanisms which prevented any PD corruption during this incident. However, some filesystems are not designed to be robust against cases where some parts of the block device presented by PD fail to initialize while others are still usable. This issue was technically external to PD, and only repairable by customers using filesystem repair utilities. The PD product team assisted affected customers in their manual recovery efforts during the extended incident window.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, up to 0.429% of PD devices in us-east1-d were unhealthy for approximately 1 hour from 2020-06-29 08:15 to 2020-06-29 09:10.  All PD devices in us-east1-d recovered automatically once power had been restored.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Cloud Networking \r\n\r\nThe us-east1 region as a whole experienced a 5% packet loss between 07:55 and 08:05 for Public IP and Network LB Traffic as Maglevs [1] servicing the region in the impacted cluster became unavailable.\r\n\r\nCloud VPN saw 7% of Classic VPN tunnels in us-east1 reset between 07:57 and 08:07. As tunnels disconnected, they were rescheduled automatically in other clusters in the region. HA VPN tunnels were not impacted.\r\n\r\nCloud Router saw 13% of BGP sessions in us-east1 flap between 07:57 and 08:07, Cloud Router tasks in the impacted cluster were rescheduled automatically in other clusters in the region.\r\n\r\nCloud HTTP(S) Load Balancing saw a 166% spike in baseline HTTP 500 errors between 08:00 to 08:10.\r\n\r\nStarting at 09:38 the network control plane in the impacted cluster began to initialize but ran into an issue that required manual intervention to resolve. Between 09:38 and 10:14 instances continued to be inaccessible until the control plane initialized, updates were also not being propagated down to the cluster control plane. Due to this, some resources such as Internal Load Balancers and instances that were deleted during this time period, and then recreated at any time between 9:38 and 12:47 would have seen availability issues. This was resolved with additional intervention from the SRE team. \r\n\r\nTo reduce time to recover for similar classes of issues, we are increasing the robustness of the control plane to better handle such exceptional failure conditions. We are also implementing additional monitoring and alerting to more quickly detect update propagation issues under exceptional failure conditions\r\n\r\n[1] https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/google-shares-software-network-load-balancer-design-powering-gcp-networking \r\n\r\n## Cloud SQL\r\n\r\nGoogle Cloud SQL experienced a 7% drop in network connections that resulted in database unavailability from 2020-06-29 08:00 - 10:50 US/Pacific affecting <1.5% of instances in us-east1 due to power loss. This degraded Cloud SQL dependencies (Persistent Disk and GCE) in us-east1-c and us-east1-d for a period of 2 hours and 50 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Filestore + Memorystore\r\n\r\nCloud Filestore and Memorystore instances in us-east1-c were unavailable due to power loss from 2020-06-29 07:56 - 10:24 US/Pacific for a duration of 2 hours and 28 minutes. 7.4% of Redis non-HA (zonal) instances in us-east1 were unavailable and 5.9% of Redis HA (regional) standard tier instances in us-east1 failed over. All Cloud Filestore and Cloud Memorystore instances recovered by 10:24.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Google Kubernetes Engine\r\n\r\nGoogle Kubernetes Engine (GKE) customers were unable to create or delete clusters in either the us-east1-c zone or the us-east1 region from 2020-06-29 8:00 to 2020-06-29 10:30 US/Pacific. Additionally, customers could not create nodepools in the us-east1-c zone during that same period. A maximum of 29% of zonal clusters in us-east1-c and 2% of zonal clusters in us-east1-d could not be administered; all but a small subset of clusters recovered by 11:00, and the remaining clusters recovered by 14:30.  Existing regional clusters in us-east1 were not affected except for customers who had workloads on nodes in us-east1-c that they could not or were unable to migrate.\r\n\r\n## Google Cloud Storage\r\n\r\nGoogle Cloud Storage (GCS) in us-east1 experienced 10 minutes of impact when availability fell down to 99.7%, with a 3-minute burst down to 98.6% availability.  GCS multi-region experienced a total of 40 minutes of impact, down to 99.55% availability. \r\n\r\n# SLA CREDITS\r\nIf you believe your paid application experienced an SLA violation as a result of this incident, please submit the SLA credit request: https://support.google.com/cloud/contact/cloud_platform_sla\r\n\r\nA full list of all Google Cloud Platform Service Level Agreements can be found at https://cloud.google.com/terms/sla/",
